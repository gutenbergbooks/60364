<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> the many books published on the behaviour
of the German Army in Belgium, this account by
a distinguished Dutch journalist must occupy a
unique place. It is written by a neutral, who held,
at the start, no brief for either side. It is written
by an eye-witness, who chronicles not what he
heard, but what he saw. It is written also by one
who mingled with the German troops and was present
at the inception of the whole campaign of outrage.
Mr. Mokveld took his life in his hands when, with
great courage and devotion, he visited Visé and
Liège and Louvain at the most critical moments.
His character of neutral journalist was only a flimsy
protection among the drunken and excited German
troops. But his boldness was justified, for after
many adventures he came safely through, and he
was enabled in those early weeks to see the whole
of Belgium from Liège to the Yser and from Antwerp
to Dinant. The result is an admirable piece of war-correspondence,
which bears on every page the
proofs of shrewd observation and a sincere love of
truth and honest dealing.</p>

<p>There is much in Mr. Mokveld's narrative to
interest the historian. For example, he gives a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
fuller account than we have yet had of that obscure
period when Liège had fallen, but its northern forts
were still holding out. But it is less a history of
the campaign than a chronicle of those lesser incidents
of war which reveal the character of the combatants.
No more crushing indictment of German
methods has been issued, the more crushing since
it is so fair and reasonable. The author has very
readily set down on the credit side any act of German
humanity or courtesy which he witnessed or heard
of. But the credit side is meagre and the black
list of crimes portentous. Episodes like the burning
of Visé and the treatment of British prisoners in
the train at Landen would be hard to match in
history for squalid horror.</p>

<p>Two facts are made clear by Mr. Mokveld's book,
if, indeed, the world has ever doubted them. The
first is that the German authorities, believing their
victory to be beyond question, deliberately sanctioned
a campaign of frightfulness. They did not
imagine that they would ever be held to account.
They wished to terrorise their opponents by showing
them what resistance involved. The atrocities
were not the blunders of drink-sodden reservists,
but the result of the theories of half-witted military
pedants. The second is that the invading armies
were as nervous as a hysterical woman. Those
would-be conquerors of the world were frightened
by their own shadows. A shot fired by accident
from a German rifle led to tales of attacks by Belgian
<i>francs-tireurs</i> and then to indiscriminate murder
by way of revenge. Mr. Mokveld examined the
legends of treacherous Belgian assaults and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
mutilation of the German wounded, and found
them in every case wholly baseless. No German
had ever seen these things happen, but had only
heard of them. When definite details were given,
Mr. Mokveld tracked them down and found them
false. The Belgian atrocities lacked even that
slender justification which belongs to reprisals.
They were the work of a drunken and "rattled"
soldiery&mdash;for fear is apt to make men brutal&mdash;deliberately
encouraged by the authorities, who
for this purpose relaxed the bonds of military discipline.
When the battle of the Marne changed
the complexion of affairs, these authorities grew
scared and repudiated the policy, but Belgium remains
a witness of what Germany's triumph means
for her victims.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>A <small>FEW</small> words by way of introduction.</p>

<p>I had wished to publish this book a long time
ago, because I think it my duty to submit to the
opinion of the public the things which I witnessed
in the unfortunate land of the Belgians, and where
I was present at such important events as an impartial
spectator. I call myself an impartial spectator,
for if this book be anti-German, it should not be
forgotten that the facts give it that tendency.</p>

<p>That the book was not published sooner is because
I could not foresee more than others how terribly
long the war would last; and I should have preferred
to wait till the end in order to insert several reports
which I know are being kept in the occupied part,
in order to acquaint the whole world with the full
truth about the behaviour of the Germans. As
long as the Germans keep the upper hand in Belgium,
such a publication cannot take place without danger
to several persons.</p>

<p>But because the German libels go on accusing
the Belgian people of horrible francs-tireurs acts,
I have thought that I ought not to wait any longer
before giving my evidence to the public.</p>

<p>This book does not attempt to give more than
evidence of the truth. It does not claim to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
literary distinction; I have not even tried to give
it that stamp. By relating various events successively
witnessed, which have no mutual connection,
this would be very difficult.</p>

<p>My stories are not exaggerated or touched up,
but are true to reality. That is the reason why the
German authorities have driven me away from
Belgium, and tried to get hold of me to punish
me. On that side they are afraid that the truth
be known.</p>

<p>A long time after I had left Belgium I got hold
of the Black List, in which I am mentioned twice
over among eighty-seven other persons; once as
Hokveld-Journalist and again as Mokveld-Correspondent.
The list was published by me in <i>De Tijd</i>
of June 2nd, 1915.</p>

<p>That I was "wanted" is proved by the fact that
two persons have had the greatest trouble because
they were mistaken for the Mokveld-Correspondent
of <i>De Tijd</i>. My colleague Kemper passed a fortnight
in prison in Brussels, accused of having written
various articles in <i>De Tijd</i>, which were written by
me, and I relate, in the chapter "Round about
Bilsen," what Mr. Van Wersch, another Netherlander,
suffered for the same reason.</p>

<p>But although the Germans are afraid to let the
truth be known, there is no reason why I should
withhold my evidence. On the contrary, I will try
to do everything I can to make public opinion do
justice to the unfortunate Belgians, trodden down
and insulted, falsely and vilely libelled by their
oppressors, and accused of offences of which they
never were guilty.</p>

<small>THE</small><br />

<big><strong>GERMAN FURY IN BELGIUM</strong></big>
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />

ON THE WAY TO LIÈGE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> <i>De Tijd</i> sent me to Belgium as its correspondent,
I had not the faintest notion practically
how to perform my duties, for the simple reason
that I could not apprehend at all how a modern
war might be conducted. But I was destined to
receive my first impressions when still on Netherland<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
territory and after my arrival at Maastricht.</p>

<p>On the hot afternoon of August 7th, 1914, the
much-delayed train rumbled into the station at Maastricht.
A dense mass stood in front of the building.
Men, women, and children were crowded there and
pushed each other weeping, shouting, and questioning.
Families and friends tried to find each other,
and many of the folk of Maastricht assisted the poor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>creatures, who, nervously excited, wept and wailed
for a father, for wife and children lost in the crowd.
It was painful, pitiful, this sight of hundreds of
fugitives, who, although now safe, constantly feared
that death was near, and anxiously clutched small
parcels, which for the most part contained worthless
trifles hurriedly snatched up when they fled.</p>

<p>And over these nervous and terrified thousands
at Maastricht rolled from afar the dull roar of the
guns, thunder-like bursts from which had frightened
them so terribly.</p>

<p>The streets leading to the bridge over the Meuse
and into the town were also densely thronged with
refugees. Here and there large groups listened to
the stories told, with profusion of tears, of sufferings
inflicted, depicted in far harsher colours than could
have been possible. But the wretched creatures
exaggerated unconsciously; in their affrighted state
they had seen things that had never occurred.</p>

<p>Suddenly every one in the Vrijthof ran in the
same direction. I waited calmly, and saw pass by
a tragically long train of hooded carts and other
peasants' conveyances. The drivers walked by the
side of the horses, the Red Cross flag flew from the
carriages, fresh clean straw covered their floor, on
which wounded soldiers writhed in excruciating
pain. The crowd did not press nearer, but, standing
silently in long rows, let the sad procession pass by.
Such were the first impressions of the war got in
these days; nobody uttered a sound, but many
stealthily brushed a tear away.</p>

<p>Thus it went on all day long: motors and other
conveyances travelled to and fro between the battle-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>fields
and hospitals at Maastricht; fugitives moved
about in streets and squares, upsetting each other
more and more by fantastic stories.</p>

<p>As dusk came on nearly the whole population of
Maastricht, with all their temporary guests, formed
an endless procession and went to invoke God's
mercy by the Virgin Mary's intercession. They
went to Our Lady's Church, in which stands the
miraculous statue of Sancta Maria Stella Maris.
The procession filled all the principal streets and
squares of the town. I took my stand at the corner
of the Vrijthof, where all marched past me, men,
women, and children, all praying aloud, with loud
voices beseeching: "Our Lady, Star of the Sea,
pray for us ... pray for us ... pray for us ...!"</p>

<p>At the same time bells rang ... and guns roared.</p>

<p>Group after group went by, and I heard French
and Netherland, the Maastricht vernacular and
sweet Flemish spoken, all sorts of tongues and modes
of utterance. The men were bare-headed, and
each let his rosary slip through his fingers. Soon
after the head of the procession reached Our Lady
Square the huge church was packed, and those
who could not find room inside stood in the
square, which also very soon was full with these
thousands of people in a dense mass, like so many
blades of grass in a meadow.</p>

<p>However large the crowd, it was silent as death
when the priest Jacobs addressed them. He spoke
words of encouragement, hope, and confidence,
and urged them to send up their prayers to God
Almighty&mdash;prayers for peace. When he had ended,
these thousands sang the "Hymn to Mary," in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
such perfect order as if only one superhuman body
sent forth an immensely powerful sound from earth
to Heaven.</p>

<p>As I was listening to that hymn the storms in my
heart subsided&mdash;storms raised by so many scenes
witnessed during the day; but as soon as the
sonorous voices were still, I heard again the dull
boom ... boom ... boom ... of the guns.
That dire reality!...</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next morning I got up early, having been
unable to sleep. I realised already that my task
was difficult, dangerous, and full of responsibility,
for I had to find out and communicate to the public
the truth about events, which would be related as
beautiful or horrid, according to the interests of
my informants. It was dangerous, because I might
meet with the same fate that seemed to have been
inflicted on so many civilians already.</p>

<p>Dressed in my sporting attire, and carrying some
necessaries in a knapsack, I started early, going towards
Visé along the canal. As I came to the
Netherland boundary-stone and noticed that of
Belgium, I had a moment of doubt, but it lasted
for a second only. In order to divert my thoughts
I walked somewhat more briskly, but was stopped
suddenly on Belgian ground by a custom-house
officer. I was astonished to see that official there
still, for the Germans must be quite near and&mdash;as
I had been told&mdash;small patrols had advanced frequently
to this point. My papers were found to
be in order, and the man seemed very happy to meet
a journalist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span></p>

<p>"It is a pity, sir, that you did not arrive a day
sooner, then you might have witnessed great
barbarity of the Germans. If you walk on a little
farther along the canal, you will see three persons
hanging from a tree near Haccourt; one of these
is a boy of fourteen. Nobody was allowed on the
road, and as a patrol met these three persons, they
concluded immediately that they were francs-tireurs,
strung them up on the tree, without a trial of any
sort, and in addition shot each a bullet through the
head. To-day another patrol arrived and had the
effrontery to tell the members of the Maastricht
Red Cross that the boy had murdered a captain.
And we are not allowed to remove the corpses.
Horrible!... horrible!"</p>

<p>"Yes," I reply, "it is bad, very bad, but is it
really all true?"</p>

<p>"True? True, sir? You go and look for
yourself! And let me tell you one thing&mdash;there
are no francs-tireurs here! We know quite well
what we may do and what not, and only a moment
ago I received a message from the Minister of the
Interior, saying that non-combatants who shoot at
the enemy expose themselves to danger and their
fellow-citizens to retaliations."</p>

<p>I asked him how things were farther on along the
Meuse, but he knew nothing. He was stationed
here, he said, and was going to stay as long as possible.
As soon as the Germans arrived, most people
fled, and those who had stayed on were no longer
allowed to leave. So he lacked all information, and
only understood that fierce fighting was going on,
as was confirmed by the incessant thunder of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
guns. Fort Pontisse was, moreover, not so very far
away, and frequently we could distinctly tell, by their
whistling sound, in which direction the shells flew.</p>

<p>After a few encouraging words I walked on along
the solitary, deserted road, leaving the canal on the
right, until a by-way took me to the bank of the
Meuse, opposite the Netherland frontier village
Eysden. I entered a deserted inn. After shouting
for a long time, the inn-keeper appeared, looked
shyly at me, remaining constantly close by the
door of his room. His attitude showed that he
was prepared to fly at the slightest suspicious movement
on my part; but as soon as I had convinced
him that I was a Netherland journalist, he became
more friendly, and called his wife and daughters, so
that I might tell them all I knew. They were
very desirous to know how the war went ... in
the Netherlands, and whether we were fighting
the Germans or the English? It was very difficult
to make them understand that they were under a
misapprehension, but when I had at last succeeded
in this, I started in my turn to ask them what they
thought of my intention to go farther.</p>

<p>"Go farther, sir? But ... but ... sir, don't
do that! The Germans shoot every civilian whom
they set eyes on."</p>

<p>"Oh, go on!" I answered. "I don't think that
I need fear anything of the kind. I am in any case
a Netherlander!"</p>

<p>"Netherlander or not, it does not matter.
Whosoever one be, every civilian is shot down by
them."</p>

<p>"Are they at a great distance from here?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span></p>

<p>"Not at all! If you step outside, you can see
them standing, ten minutes from here. Near
Lixhe they threw a bridge across the Meuse. It
is the third already which they put down, for each
time they are smashed from the fort. Oh, it is
horrible; there must surely fall a number of dead,
and here we have seen corpses in the Meuse already....
But I do not understand how you ventured to
come here...."</p>

<p>Well, I did not quite fancy the prospect of being
shot like a dog, and as I had not yet come into touch
with the Germans, it was difficult to say whether
these people exaggerated or not. But just opposite
was Eysden, and I made up my mind to go there
for further information.</p>

<p>Netherland soldiers and inhabitants of the village
bustled about along the opposite river-bank. I
shouted as loudly as possible; and when at last I
succeeded in drawing their attention, I made them
understand that I wanted to be pulled across in
the little boat, which in ordinary times served as
a ferry. A short consultation took place now on
the opposite side, after which a soldier, who clearly
possessed a strong voice, came as near as possible to
the waterside and, making a trumpet of his two
hands, roared:</p>

<p>"Not allowed!"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"We are neutrals!"</p>

<p>"So am I; I am a Netherlander!"</p>

<p>"Possibly! Not allowed!"</p>

<p>And at the same moment he turned round and
joined the others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span></p>

<p>So I was left there. The Netherlanders refused
to pull me across in consequence of an exaggerated
fear of violating their neutrality; the Germans in
front of me intended, it was said, to shoot me down
as soon as I ventured to get near. But to retrace
my steps ... that is a thing I had never done yet.
For a few moments I stood there undecided, but
then made up my mind to see what was going to
happen, and went on, in spite of the warnings of
the kind-hearted innkeeper and his family, who called
out to me to return.</p>

<p>The terrible thunder of the guns, of both besiegers
and besieged, vibrated through the air. In
the distance I noticed a couple of men, probably
German soldiers, but a pontoon-bridge was nowhere
to be seen. After a few minutes, however, I reached
a spot where the Meuse makes a short curve, and
had scarcely walked round it, when I saw, only a
couple of hundred yards away, the bridge in question,
across which a long train of vehicles was passing,
loaded with victuals, hay, straw, etc.</p>

<p>On this side hundreds of soldiers were standing;
they had taken off their uniforms in the fierce heat,
and were busy loading and unloading and changing
horses. From time to time the entire scene was
hidden by the smoke from numerous burning houses
at Lixhe, quite near the river. I walked in the
most casual way, in an unconcerned attitude, looked
calmly at some of the houses I passed, and which
were for the greater part destroyed. The walls
were pierced by bullets, the rooms generally burnt
out; in the front gardens lay all sorts of furniture,
dragged out of the house and then smashed to pieces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span></p>

<p>The road was all strewn with straw. I approached
the bridge past burning farms and villas. There
the pieces of broken furniture were even lying in
the road, and I had to go warily so that I should not
stumble. The soldiers looked at me as if they were
amused, but I went up to them in the same unconcerned
manner and asked them to take me to their
commanding officer.</p>

<p>"What do you want with him?"</p>

<p>"I am a Netherland journalist, and want to ask
the commander's permission to go to Liège."</p>

<p>"Oh, you are a Netherlander; then come along."</p>

<p>They took me to two officers who stood near the
bridge, and told them that I "pretended" to be
a Netherland journalist. Having proved this by
my papers, the officers gave me an escort of three
men, who conducted me to the bridge-commander,
on the other side of the Meuse.</p>

<p>I had to walk along the very edge of the unstable
bridge in order to avoid the wheels of the passing
carriages, which shook the whole bridge and made
the rather loose boards clatter. In the meantime,
at no considerable distance, some shells fell in the
Meuse, fired at the bridge from Fort Pontisse. Yet,
I did not mind it at all, as all these new experiences
stunned me, so to speak; the incessant hellish
noises of the batteries, the burning houses, the smoke
swooping down, the excited soldiers....</p>

<p>As we crossed the bridge, I asked my escort why
these houses were set on fire. I heard then, for
the first time, that "they had been shooting,"
and they told me of cowardly civilians, who shot
from the windows at unsuspicious soldiers, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
stabbed them treacherously. But of course they
had experienced nothing of the kind; it had happened
to troops who were now moving ahead.
They had, however, taken part in the revenge, and
told of it with glittering eyes: how they fired the
houses of francs-tireurs and then shot the people
who, nearly stifled, appeared at the windows; how
in "holy" anger, in order to avenge their comrades,
they subsequently entered the houses and destroyed
everything. I did not answer, did not know what
to think of it, but shuddered, because it was so
gruesome.</p>

<p>They told this, while we were waiting on a couple
of protruding boards of the pontoon-bridge, so as
to allow some extremely wide carts to pass. Once
again shells exploded, a couple of hundred yards
behind us, and one made a hole in the bank quite
near.</p>

<p>"Horrible!" I sighed. "Have they not yet hit
the bridge?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, it has been destroyed already a couple
of times, but we shall teach them a lesson! Why
did not the Belgians allow us to pass through their
country? What can their little army do against
us? As soon as a sufficient number have crossed
we shall go for these forts, then on to Brussels, and
within a fortnight we shall be in Paris. Liège we
have taken already."</p>

<p>"It will cost a great many men!"</p>

<p>"We have plenty of them; but many of us fall
by the treacherous shooting of the civilians; they
are swine, swine! And these Belgian women ...
they are the dirtiest bitches ... beastly swine...."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span></p>

<p>The man got more and more excited, but then
he was more than "half-seas over." The smoke
made him cough and he stuck in the middle of his
"swine." He made me shudder, and I hastened
to pull out a packet of cigarettes, some of which
I gave to him and his mates. In consequence the
two others became more communicative, and in
touching harmony assured me that:</p>

<p>"Oh yes, the Netherlanders are our friends; they
remain neutral. And that is the best, for otherwise
the whole lot would be smashed up, exactly as here
in Belgium."</p>

<p>They did not understand, of course, that poor
Belgium would have liked nothing better than to
remain neutral also.</p>

<p>Those wide carts had passed us now, and we could
proceed slowly. The bridge led to a farmhouse
with tall trees and underwood. They took me
to the right, to a densely overgrown spot, where a
clearing had been made amidst some smaller shrubs.
In the centre stood a table covered with a shining
white cloth, and a goodly number of wine-bottles
and glasses. Half a dozen officers in fine uniforms,
gilt collars and epaulettes, were seated around it.</p>

<p>The sight of that small group, hidden among the
green foliage, was as brilliant as it was surprising.
One of the officers, clearly the highest in rank,
summoned us to come nearer, and asked the soldiers
for an explanation. Standing smartly at attention,
they gave it, as a school-child might haltingly recite
a lesson learned by heart. The officer whom I
thought it convenient to call "Captain" looked
searchingly at me and then began:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you got papers?"</p>

<p>"Yes, captain."</p>

<p>I pulled them out: birth certificate, certificate
of good conduct, foreign passport, and press-card,
which were examined the one after the other.</p>

<p>"Are they genuine?"</p>

<p>"Of course, captain; everything is properly
signed, stamped, and legalised."</p>

<p>"And what do you want to write about?"</p>

<p>"I don't know yet. The things I see ... and
... of course that cannot do harm to the German
army."</p>

<p>"Hm! Hm! All right. So you intend to
write friendly about us?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, certainly, sir! Exactly because we
hear so many lies from foreign countries about the
Germans, I want to try and find out the truth for
myself."</p>

<p>"Is that so? Well, the Netherlanders are our
friends, and have so much in common with our
people."</p>

<p>"Certainly, captain; as a matter of fact we are
of the same race."</p>

<p>But here he looked at me in a curious manner,
scrutinising my face, as if he asked himself: "Is he
pulling my leg, or not?" But not a muscle in my
face moved, so that the "Captain" nodded approvingly
... and wrote out a pass for me to go
to Visé! I was not allowed to go to Liège, for, as
he said, he did not yet know himself how matters
stood there. The other officers overwhelmed me
with questions: how matters stood in The Netherlands,
and whether Great Britain had already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
declared war against us? I think that at that question
I looked utterly perplexed, for in the same
breath they told me all they knew about the danger
of war for The Netherlands: Great Britain first
sent an ultimatum to The Netherlands, to force her
into joining the Allies against Germany, and as she
had refused, the British Fleet was now on its way to
Flushing. I explained to them in detail that they
were utterly wrong, but they believed only a half
of what I said.</p>

<p>There was a continuous coming and going at the
bridge-command, for when I left the shrubberies
a great many soldiers of high and low rank, with
portfolios and documents, were waiting outside. The
soldiers were to escort me back across the bridge,
so that I might go on to Visé along the other bank.</p>

<p>Before I got to the bridge I saw something gruesome:
a number of corpses of soldiers were lying
about and others were brought in ... a little
farther away, on the farm, there they were digging....
I looked away quickly; I was not yet accustomed
to that sort of thing. Most likely they were
men killed a moment ago by shells aimed at the
bridge, for wounded men were also brought in on
stretchers.</p>

<p>At the other end of the bridge I was left by my
escort, and went on alone; on my left the Meuse,
on my right burning houses, above me hissing and
whistling shells, that came down in front of me and
behind me, with tremendous explosions, throwing
the loose earth high into the air.</p>

<p>In Devant-le-Pont, a hamlet opposite Visé, the
doors of all the houses stood open, as a sign that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
inhabitants did not propose to offer any resistance
to the Germans. After much shouting the landlady
of a café appeared, distressingly nervous, but
doing her utmost to look unconcerned.</p>

<p>"A glass of beer, madame."</p>

<p>"If you please."</p>

<p>"The guns are horrid, madame; are you not
afraid?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, we must hope for the best."</p>

<p>"Have the Germans done no harm here yet?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, sir, not at all!"</p>

<p>"Are they tolerably kind?"</p>

<p>"Oh, quite nice people, sir!"</p>

<p>Her reserve told me that I would not get much
information here, and, finishing my beer, I asked:</p>

<p>"How much is it, madame?"</p>

<p>"This? Nothing, sir, nothing."</p>

<p>"Nothing! But, madame, I want to pay for
what I drink!"</p>

<p>"No, no, I won't take anything for it. It is
hot, is it not, and a soldier ought to get something...."</p>

<p>I understood only then why the woman was so
full of praise of the Germans, although she was
shaking in her shoes: she thought I was a soldier!
How heavily weighed the oppressor's hand on the
wretched population, if now already the honest
Belgian heart became hypocritical!</p>

<p>I had great trouble to make her understand that
I was a Netherlander; and that changed at once
her opinion for the Germans. She told me then
that her husband and children had fled to The
Netherlands, as had most of the inhabitants, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
that she was left behind merely because she dawdled
too long. And now she was constantly afraid that
they might fire her house as they did the others, and
murder her ... for such had been the fate of
several of the villagers. Even whole families had
been killed.</p>

<p>Many civilians had been put to death, accused of
having shot from the houses, and others for refusing
to give up requisitioned food. Probably they had
none, as preceding military divisions had already
taken away all there was. Then some civilians
were killed for refusing to work for the enemy.
The houses of all these "condemned" had been
burnt, and everything the soldiers fancied was
looted. As a matter of fact, nearly all the soldiers
I met later on were drunk, and they worried me
constantly. Only when I had proved to be a
Netherlander, they behaved a little better, and
started abusing "the cursed Belgians," who, according
to them, were all francs-tireurs.</p>

<p>A short distance beyond this little café lies the
large bridge across the Meuse. Before the Germans
arrived it was partly destroyed by the Belgians,
but so inadequately that obviously the enemy could
repair it easily. Bombs were therefore fired regularly
from Fort Pontisse at the bridge, and only an
hour ago it had been hit, with the result that a big
hole was made in the undamaged part. In the
road also big holes were made by the exploding
projectiles. Having passed underneath the viaduct
of the bridge, I found myself opposite Visé on the
sloping bank of the Meuse. Two boys had been
commanded by the Germans to work the ferry-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>boat
for them, and after I had shown them my
passport, they took me to the other side.</p>

<p>It was a fine summer afternoon, and the sun shone
on the many bright, whitewashed walls of the old
and neat little town, built close to the rapidly
flowing river. There was quiet in the streets,
although nearly all the inhabitants were sitting on
their chairs in the streets. But nobody ventured
to move about, and conversations were held only
in whispers. As I walked through the village street
in my quaint get-up, they pushed their chairs a little
closer together as if frightened, and looked shyly
at me as if they feared that I was not the harbinger
of much good. And all these hundreds of people
saluted me humbly, almost cringingly, which filled
me with pity.</p>

<p>Visé had not been burnt yet, as had been reported
in The Netherlands. Only here and there had the
shells done some damage, and hundreds of window-panes
had been burst by the vibration of the air.
As a token of submission to the invader, small white
flags hung from all the windows, and these, along
the whole length of a street, made a decidedly
lamentable impression.</p>

<p>The inhabitants had already had a variety of
experiences. On Tuesday, August 4th, the first
German troops arrived before the little town. The
gendarmes stationed there offered resistance to the
invading enemy, but, being hopelessly outnumbered,
they were all shot down. As they were lying on the
ground, badly wounded, Dr. Frits Goffin, head of
St. Hadelin College, came in great haste as soon as
he heard the shooting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span></p>

<p>All the wounded were Roman Catholics, and as
they saw the approaching priest, they implored
him in a loud voice to give them absolution of sins,
some making an act of contrition. The priest was
unable to come near each of them, and therefore
called out in a loud voice: "My Jesus, be merciful!"
He then gave them all absolution of sins.
But as he kneeled down to perform this sacred task,
a hostile bullet whizzed past his ear, and several
soldiers who ran by aimed at him, so that he had to
seek safety behind a tree. I saw with my own eyes
five bullet-holes in the tree that was pointed out
to me.</p>

<p>In those first days many civilians were killed, and
not only in Visé, but still more in the surrounding
villages, Mouland and Berneaux, which were soon
burnt down and where many a good man was
brought low by the murderous bullets. The savage
soldiers killed the cattle also, and a large number of
carcases had been lying about for days.</p>

<p>At Visé many men had been commanded to do
certain kinds of work, cutting down trees, making
of roads, bridges, and so on. Many of them never
returned, because they refused to do the humiliating
work and were shot. Among these there were even
aged people; and I myself stood by the death-bed
of a man of ninety, who had been forced to assist
in building a bridge, until the poor wretch broke
down and was carried to St. Hadelin College, turned
into a hospital by Dr. Goffin; there he died.</p>

<p>No wonder that the inhabitants were afraid and
looked askance at me as they mistook me for a
German.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span></p>

<p>On this day, August 8th, the reign of terror was
still in full force. There were repeated threats to
burn the town and to kill the inhabitants if they
objected to do work or to deliver certain goods,
especially wine and gin, of which thousands of
bottles were requisitioned daily. Several times a
day they were summoned by a bell and informed
what the invader wanted, the necessary threats
being added to the command. And the inhabitants,
in mortal fear, no longer trusted each other, but
searched each other's houses for things that might
be delivered to satisfy the Germans.</p>

<p>The entire neighbourhood was still being bombarded
from the forts to the north of Liège; several
German divisions succeeded, however, in crossing
the Meuse near Lixhe. In spite of the shell-fire
they passed the pontoon-bridge there, turned into
a by-way leading to the canal, near Haccourt, crossed
one of the canal-bridges, of which not one had
been destroyed, and along another by-way, came
to the main road from Maastricht to Tongres, at
a spot about three miles from the last-named town.</p>

<p>The shelling went on during the night, and all
that time the inhabitants remained in their cellars.</p>

<p>Although I had got farther on my way than I
had dared to expect, my journalist's heart longed
for more. If I could get to Liège, which was said
to have just been taken! But my passport stated
that I was only allowed to go to Visé. I thought
the matter out, and the longer I thought, the
stronger became my desire to go on; and at last
I decided to do it.</p>

<p>Near the outskirts of the town I found barricades<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
which, however, seemed not to have been used, but
stray shells had knocked large pieces out of the low,
wide wall between the road and the Meuse's flowing
water.</p>

<p>There was not much traffic. Only here and
there stood some German soldiers, or seriously
wounded men were lying on mattresses and chairs.
Nearly every house by the roadside had been turned
into an emergency hospital, for from all sides they
brought in soldiers wounded by shells that had
exploded amidst the advancing divisions.</p>

<p>The road along which I walked, the main road
between Visé and Liège, was laid under fire from
various forts, and every moment I saw on my left
clouds rise up from the rocky heights that run along
the whole of the Meuse. These clouds were partly
formed by smoke from the guns mounted by the
Germans against the forts, partly by volumes of
earth thrown up by the projectiles from the broken-up
soil.</p>

<p>I myself ran great risks too, but I did not mind,
and walked on, moved by a consuming desire to get
to Liège, and then back to Maastricht, to be able
to wire to my paper that I had been to Liège
only just after it was taken by the Germans, and
that the news, wired from Germany to the
Netherland papers, that the forts had been taken
was untrue.</p>

<p>I had a short chat with the wounded men near
the various houses, on demand showed my passport
to those in authority, and was advised as a friendly
Netherlander to return, as it was extremely dangerous
on the road. But I did not dream of doing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
this, as long as I was not compelled, and went on
towards Liège amidst this maddening thunder.</p>

<p>I had walked another three miles, when a big
crowd of fugitives met me. They seemed to have
come a long way, for the majority could hardly walk
on, and had taken off their shoes and boots, on
account of the scorching heat, going on barefooted
in the shade of the tall trees. It was a procession,
numbering hundreds of men, women, and children.
The aged were supported, the babies carried. Most
of them had a small parcel on their back or under
their arm. They seemed tired to death, had dark
red faces, and betrayed great fear and nervousness.
I crossed the road to speak to them, and as soon
as they noticed it the whole crowd, numbering
hundreds of people, stood still, creeping closer
together, women and girls trying hard to hide
themselves behind the men, and these doffed their
caps timidly.</p>

<p>I was really sorry that I had dressed myself in
that grey Norfolk suit, long stockings, a knapsack
strapped to the back, and a leather strap with a
water-bottle. The unfortunate creatures thought
that I was a German soldier. I was bewildered
for a moment, but then guessed their thoughts and
hastened to comfort them.</p>

<p>I could not get much information from them.
Twenty spoke at the same time; in halting, incoherent
words they tried to tell me of their experiences,
but I could only catch: killed ... murders
... fire ... guns.... After much trouble I
gathered that they came from the villages to the
north of Liège, where the Germans had told them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
that on that same day, within an hour, everything
would be burned down. Everybody had left these
places, a good many had gone to Liège, but these
people did not think it safe there either, and wanted
to go on to The Netherlands.</p>

<p>After giving them some advice how to get to
The Netherlands, and offering some words of
sympathy, I wanted to go on, but as they realised
this, the poor, kind creatures surrounded me; many
women began to weep, and from all sides they cried:</p>

<p>"To Liège? You want to go to Liège? But,
sir!&mdash;but, sir! We fled to escape death, because the
Germans are going to burn down everything and
shoot everybody. Please don't, sir; they'll kill you
... kill you ... shoot you ... kill you!"</p>

<p>"Come, come," I replied, touched by the kind
anxiety of these people. "Come, come; it won't
be as bad as all that, and, then, I am a Netherlander."</p>

<p>That "being a Netherlander" had become my
stock-argument, and, as a matter of fact, it made me
feel calmer. Quietly I made myself free of the
surrounding crowd, in order to proceed on my way;
but then they got hold of my arms and gently tried
to induce me to go with them, so I had to speak
more firmly to make them understand that they
could not prevail on me. When at last I was able
to resume my march, they looked back frequently,
shaking their heads, and in their anxiety for me,
their fellow-creature, they seemed to forget for a
moment their own hardly bearable sorrows.</p>

<p>A moment later a gigantic motor-car came racing
down at a great speed. Six soldiers stood up in it,
their rifles pointed at me. I thought that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
intended to shoot me and everybody they might
meet, but a seventh soldier standing by the side of
the chauffeur made a movement with his arms,
from which I understood that he wanted me to put
my hands up. I did so.</p>

<p>It is a simple affair, this putting up one's hands,
but even at such a moment a free citizen has a
strong objection against being compelled to this
by others, who are no more than one's self, who ask
it without any right, except the might derived from
the weapon in their hands.</p>

<p>When they had passed, I looked round at the people
I had left a moment ago.... There they lay in
the road, kneeling, lifting their trembling hands,
although the motor-car was already a couple of
hundred yards away.</p>

<p>Argenteau was not damaged much, but the
inhabitants remained quietly inside their houses,
or probably stayed in their cellars, for fear of the
shells that tore through the air constantly.</p>

<p>By and by I began to feel that I had already
walked about twenty miles in this great heat, but
I would not think of stopping before reaching my
goal.</p>

<p>At Cherath railway-carriages were lying in the
road at the level-crossing of Visé-Liège line, farther
on barbed-wire cut into pieces, felled trees, and so
on. German soldiers had moved these things out
of the way, and motor-cars could pass by again. In
the village itself I saw a man, with a white armlet,
posting up a bill, and as I had seen similar damp
bills sticking on the walls in the other villages, I
drew nearer to read it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>

The bill ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Community of ...</p>

<p class="center">"<i>To the inhabitants.</i></p>

<p>"The powerful German army, victorious in our district,
has promised to respect our land and private possessions.</p>

<p>"In the circumstances in which we are placed it is necessary
to retain the greatest possible tranquillity and calm.</p>

<p>"The burgomaster informs the population that any utterance
contrary to the regulations will be severely punished.</p>

<p class="right">
"<span class="smcap">The Burgomaster.</span>"
</p></blockquote>

<p>The bill-poster replied "yes" or "no" to my
questions, whichever answer fitted, and as soon as
he had finished his task he hurriedly trotted off.
I did not see any other inhabitant.</p>

<p>Outside Cherath a motor-car stood between some
partially removed trees. Two officers and three
soldiers stood around a map which they had laid
on the ground, and with them was a young girl,
scarcely twenty years old. She was weeping, and
pointed out something on the map, obviously compelled
to give information. One of the officers
stopped me, was clearly quite satisfied with my
papers, but told me that I was not allowed to go
on without a permit from the military command.
Then I pulled out of my pocket, as if of great importance,
the scrap of paper which the commanding
officer at the bridge near Lixhe had given me. The
other had scarcely seen the German letters and
German stamp when he nodded his head approvingly,
and quickly I put the thing back, so that he might
not notice that I was allowed only to go to Visé.</p>

<p>At Jupile I saw a pontoon-bridge, not in use for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
the moment. Just before this place a slightly
sloping road leads from the hills to the eastern bank
of the Meuse and the main road Visé-Liège. Along
this road descended at that moment an immense
military force&mdash;uhlans, cuirassiers, infantry, more
cuirassiers, artillery, munition and forage-carts.
The train seemed endless, and although I stood there
looking at it for quite a long time, the end had not
passed me.</p>

<p>It was an imposing sight to see all these various
divisions in their brilliant uniforms coming down
along the road, the soldiers' uniforms still without
a stain, the horses in new, fine, strong leather harness,
and the rumbling and jolting guns. The soldiers
sang patriotic songs, and among them rode the
officers, proud and imperious, many with a monocle,
looking round superciliously.</p>

<p>I was the only civilian in that road, and the soldiers,
with much curiosity, stared at me. Whenever I
noticed an officer, I gave an elaborate military salute,
and with such an air that the officers, although
hesitating at first, did not fail to return the salute.</p>

<p>After reaching the main road they turned to the
right towards Visé, probably in order to try to cross
the Meuse near Lixhe and then proceed to Tongres
along the above-mentioned road. It would not be
an easy undertaking, for the forts refused to keep
silent, and already many a wounded man was carried
on a comrade's horse.</p>

<p>Liège now loomed up in the distance, and the
nearer I got, the more civilians I met. They all
wore a white armlet, and walked timidly and nervously
by the side of the road or street, starting at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
each thunder-clap of the guns. Near the entrance
to the town a small crowd stood on one of the hills,
looking at a flying-machine moving from fort to
fort and over the city, obviously investigating the
effect of the German siege-guns.</p>

<p>At seven o'clock in the evening I entered Liège;
and so far I had achieved my end.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

IN LIÈGE AND BACK TO MAASTRICHT</h2>

<p>A <small>GLORIOUS</small> summer evening, quite refreshing after
the exhausting heat of the day. Nature invited to
restfulness, and so much the more cruel sounded
the incessant thunder of the guns, which also
boomed from the citadel. As soon as the Germans
had taken possession of this old, dilapidated fortress
they proceeded to drag their guns on to it, and
trained them on the surrounding forts.</p>

<p>The streets offered the same aspect as those at
Visé. From each house floated the pitiful little
white flag; the people sat together on their
"stoeps," for they did not venture out in the streets.
Everywhere I was again saluted in the same cringingly
polite manner, and eyed with suspicion.</p>

<p>Crowds of soldiers moved through the main
streets, revelling, shouting, screaming in their mad
frenzy of victors. They sat, or stood, or danced in
the cafés, and the electrical pianos and organs had
been started again "by order." Doors and windows
were opened wide, and through the streets sounded
forth the song "Deutschland über Alles" (Germany
before all other), which affected the inhabitants
as a provocation and a challenge. Oh! one could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
see so clearly how thousands of citizens suffered
from it, how they felt hurt in their tenderest sentiments.
Dull and depressed they stared in front of
them, and whenever their set features relaxed, it
was a scornful grin.</p>

<p>From warehouses and from shops bales of corn,
flour, sugar, and other goods were taken, thrown in
heaps and then placed on all sorts of carts and
motors. In the most frequented parts military
bands had taken their stand, and played amidst the
loud jubilation of the soldiers.</p>

<p>I walked about a little longer to examine the
damage done. The fine <i>Pont des Arches</i> was for the
greater part destroyed by the retreating Belgians,
as well as the <i>Pont Maghin</i>. This is a pity, especially
as regards the first-named bridge, so famous as a
work of art, and the more so as other bridges had
not been touched and could be used by the Germans.
The bombardment did not damage the town to
any great extent, but it was remarkable that the
largest houses had suffered most.</p>

<p>Having walked some thirty miles that day, I began
to feel a serious need for rest. But when I applied,
there was no room anywhere in the hotels, and
where there was room they told me the contrary
after a critical glance at my outfit.</p>

<p>I then tried to find the nunnery of the <i>Sœurs de
la Miséricorde</i>, where one of my cousins had taken
the veil. At last, in the Rue des Clarisses I found
the huge door of the monastery, and rang the bell.
After a few moments a small trellised shutter in the
stout door was opened ajar, and a tremulous voice
asked in French what I wanted. I assumed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
it was one of the nuns, but I could see nothing
through that narrow jar.</p>

<p>"Sister," I said, "I am a cousin of Sœur Eulalie,
and should like to see her, to know how she is and
take her greetings to her family in The Netherlands."</p>

<p>"Sœur Eulalie!... Sœur Eulalie!... You
... you ... are a ... cousin ... of ... Sœur
Eulalie?"</p>

<p>The terrified little sister was unable to stammer
anything more, and in great fear suddenly closed
the little shutter again.</p>

<p>There I was left! After waiting a while I rang
the bell once more, and once more the little shutter
was opened in the same timid manner.</p>

<p>"Now, look here, sister, I am a cousin of
Sœur...."</p>

<p>"No, no, sir, your cousin ... is not here."</p>

<p>Bang! The shutter was closed again. But I
did not give it up, for I needed the sisters' assistance
to find a shelter somewhere. Once more I made
the bell to clang, and although I was kept waiting
a little longer, at last I heard voices whispering
behind the gate and once more something appeared
behind the trellis.</p>

<p>"Sister," I said then, "if you will only ask Sœur
Eulalie to come to this gate she will recognise me,
of course?"</p>

<p>"She is your cousin, you say?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, sister. Tell her that Bart of Uncle
Henry is here." Again I was switched off, but the
communication was this time restored after a few
moments, and then I heard a joyful and surprised
exclamation:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>

"Oh! Bart, is it you?"</p>

<p>So at last the lock of the heavy door screeched,
and I was admitted. I noticed that about a score
of sisters had gathered behind the gate and were
anxiously discussing the "strange occurrence." My
meeting with Sœur Eulalie, however, was so cordial
that the good nuns lost all anxiety, and I was taken
inside accompanied by nearly all the inmates of the
convent.</p>

<p>They first wanted me to explain what put it into
my head to come to Liège, and how I had managed
to get there; but as the sisters heard of my empty
stomach and my thirty miles, they would not listen
to another word before I had put myself round a
good square meal.</p>

<p>In the meantime they themselves had a word or
two to say about the fright I gave them; for when
I stood at the door they mistook me in my sporting
habit for a German officer, and the top of my water-bottle
for the butt of a revolver!</p>

<p>The work of these sisters is the education of
neglected children, and they spoke about their fears
during the last momentous days. During the
bombardment they stayed night and day with all
those little ones in the heavily vaulted cellars of the
nunnery, praying all the time before the Blessed
Sacrament that had been removed from the chapel
and taken into the cellar for safety.</p>

<p>They constantly heard the boom, boom of the
shells exploding near by, and each time thought that
their last hour had struck. The gloomy cellar
depressed them still more, and nobody really believed
that there was any chance of being saved. So the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
little sisters prayed on, preparing each other for
death, and looking for the approaching end in quiet
resignation.</p>

<p>For the moment all they knew was that the Germans
were in the town, as none of them yet had
ventured outside the building. At present their
great fear was that Germans might be billeted on
them.... Oh! they might take everything if only
they did not come themselves.</p>

<p>When I left I got a lot of addresses of relations
in The Netherlands, and undertook to send a
postcard to each of these. They also gave me an
introduction to the proprietor of an hotel whom they
knew, in which they asked him to give me a bed;
and thus armed I succeeded at last. It was high
time too, for at nine o'clock everyone had to be
at home. In the hotel everything was dark, for
there was no gas in the town. At last I could lie
down on my bed, and had a good rest, although I
could not sleep a wink. I was too tired and had
seen and experienced too much that day.</p>

<p>The next morning at six I was out and about
again. I had not been able to get any breakfast, for
the people themselves had nothing. The Germans
had called at all the hotels and shops requisitioning
everything in stock to feed the thousands who had
invaded Liège like so many locusts. The inhabitants
practically starved during those days, and carefully
saved up bits of bread already as hard as bricks.
It was a good thing that the night before I had
eaten something at the nunnery, for although at a
shop I offered first one, and later on two francs for
a piece of bread, I could not get any.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>

All the forts thundered away again, and the guns
of the Germans were also busy on the citadel and
the various surrounding heights. Already early in
the morning a terrible and suffocating smoke of
fire and gunpowder hovered over Liège. The
smoke came down also from the burning villages,
like Bressoux, on the slopes of the hills near Liège.
The flames flared up from the houses and offered a
melancholy sight.</p>

<p>German officers told me, with full particulars,
how the inhabitants of those burning villages had
offered German soldiers poisoned cocoa, coffee, and
cigarettes, for which crime three hundred civilians
had been shot during the night in a Liège square.</p>

<p>As even high officers told me those things, not
without some emotion, I began to believe them
and wrote something about them to my paper.
But what was made clear to me at a later visit!
That there was not a word of truth in the whole
story of that poisoning; that on that day and in
that square no shooting had taken place; that a
couple of days before the population had been
ordered to leave their houses within two hours
without any reason being given; and afterwards
several houses had simply been burned down.</p>

<p>The Liège people were already up and about, and
wandered through the streets full of fear, for all
sorts of rumours were heard&mdash;that civilians were
murdered, the town was to be burned down, and
that a start would be made very soon. As they
looked at those burning hamlets yonder they believed
the rumours, and went nearly mad for fear;
the men as well as the women could not help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
themselves, and wept. During the night various
posters were stuck on the walls about military action.
The following is the translation of one of these:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The municipal Government of Liège remind their
fellow-citizens, and all staying within this city, that international
law most strictly forbids civilians to commit hostilities
against the German soldiers occupying the country.</p>

<p>"Every attack on German troops by others than the
military in uniform not only exposes those who may be guilty
to be shot summarily, but will also bring terrible consequences
on leading citizens of Liège now detained in the citadel as
hostages by the Commander of the German troops. These
hostages are:&mdash;</p>

<ul><li>"1. The Right Rev. Rutten, bishop of Liège.</li>

<li>"2. Kleyer, burgomaster of Liège.</li>

<li>"3. Grégoire, permanent deputy.</li>

<li>"4. Armand Fléchet, senator.</li>

<li>"5. Van Zuylen, senator.</li>

<li>"6. Eduard Peltzer, senator.</li>

<li>"7. Colleaux, senator.</li>

<li>"8. de Ponthière, member of the Town Council.</li>

<li>"9. Van Hoeyaerden, member of the Town Council.</li>

<li>"10. Falloise, alderman.</li></ul>

<p>"Bishop Rutten and Mr. Kleyer are allowed to leave the
citadel for the present, but remain at the disposition of the
German commanders as hostages.</p>

<p>"We beseech all residents in the municipality to guard the
highest interests of all the inhabitants and of those who are
hostages of the German Army, and not to commit any assault
on the soldiers of this army.</p>

<p>"We remind the citizens that by order of the general
commanding the German troops, those who have arms in
their possession must deliver them immediately to the authorities
at the Provincial Palace under penalty of being shot.</p>

<p class="right">
"The Acting Burgomaster,<br />

</p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Liège</span>,<br />
"August 8th."
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span></p>

<p>Fear reigned everywhere in the bustling streets;
people shouted at each other that the villages burned
already, that by and by they would start with the
town, that all civilians would be killed, and other
terrible things. The Germans looked at all this
with cynical composure, and when I asked some of
them what the truth was, they shrugged their
shoulders, said that they knew nothing about it, but
that it might be true, because all Belgians were swine
who shot at the soldiers or poisoned them. All of
them were furious because the Belgians did not
allow them to march through their country.</p>

<p>Fugitives arrived from the surrounding villages,
who also spoke of nothing but arson, destruction,
and murder. They frightened the Liège population
still more, hundreds of whom packed up some of
their belongings and fled. They stumbled and fell
across the barricades in the streets, blinded as they
were by fear, and blinded also by the smoke which
settled down on the city and polluted the air.</p>

<p>Matters stood so in Liège on the morning of
August 9th, when the second day of the occupation
by the Germans had not yet passed. The Belgian
field army, which had bravely defended the ground
under the protection of the forts, and inflicted
heavy losses upon the Germans, had to retreat before
their superior numbers, leaving the further defence
of the Meuse to the forts. But a high price had
been paid for Liège, for the German losses were
immense, and on the ninth they were still busy
burying their dead. The Germans lost many men,
especially near Lixhe and the Forts Bachon and
Fleron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span></p>

<p>At that moment the possession of Liège was of
little advantage to the Germans, as on this 9th of
August the Belgians still held all the forts. This was
the most important news that I was about to send
to The Netherlands, for when I left the Netherland
newspapers had published the news wired from
Berlin that all the forts had fallen.</p>

<p>But the Germans were efficient, for during the
night they had laid down the rails on which in the
morning they transported parts of the heavy ordnance
that would demolish all the Belgian defences.</p>

<p>A few minutes after I left the town a scene drew
my attention. A lady stood there with a little
girl; the lady seemed to urge the child to do something
to which it objected. She refused to take
a bag full of various small parcels pressed upon her,
and clutched hold of the lady's skirts. I wanted to
know what was the matter, got a little nearer, and
was amazed to hear them both speak Netherland.
I could not help asking what the trouble was and
whether I might be of service.</p>

<p>"No, no, sir," the lady said. "Oh, oh, it is so
terrible! By and by the Germans will burn Liège
and kill us all. She is the little daughter of my
brother at Maastricht, and came to visit us a few
days before war broke out, but now she will be
killed too, for she refuses to go away."</p>

<p>"But, madame, you do not mean to send that
child to Maastricht by itself?"</p>

<p>"It must be done, surely, it must be done!
That is her only chance of escape, and if she stops
here she will be killed with the rest of us. Oh!...
oh!..."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span></p>

<p>"But really, madame, that is only senseless gossip
of the people. You need not be afraid, the Germans
will not be so cruel as all that!"</p>

<p>"Not? Oh! they are sure to do it. All the
villages are burning already. The smoke suffocates
us here. In Bressoux there is not a house left
standing, and in other villages all civilians have been
killed, men, women, and children. Not even the
tiniest babies escaped.... Oh!... and now it
is Liège's turn!"</p>

<p>I knew about Bressoux. I had seen the flames
burst out from many houses, and I had reliable
information also from other villages about the
slaughter that took place there, although this lady
of course exaggerated when she said that "not even
the tiniest babies escaped."</p>

<p>Need I say that I did all I could to make the
woman a little more reasonable, and make her
understand that it would not do to let a child of
ten walk by itself from Liège to Maastricht, and
least of all in these dire times. But I could not make
her see this, and this instance proves all the more,
perhaps, how upset the inhabitants of Liège were
that morning; they were nearly out of their senses
for fear.</p>

<p>Of course I did not allow the little girl to go by
herself, but took her with me. It was a wearying
expedition in the excessive heat of that day. Very
soon the child was no longer able to carry her small
belongings, and, though already sufficiently loaded
myself, I had to take her bundle as well. She was
scarcely able to walk more than a thousand yards at
a stretch, and had then to sit down on the grass by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
the roadside and rest. She did not quite understand
what was going on, but she had an undefined
feeling of fear on that long, deserted road, where
we did not meet anybody except some well-hidden
or stealthily moving German patrols who suddenly
pointed their rifles at us.</p>

<p>After the explanations required of us they allowed
us to go on. The incessant roar of the guns made
the girl tremble for fear, and the stinging smoke
made her cough. After much trouble we got at
last as far as Herstal, where I had promised her a
short rest.</p>

<p>This fine large village, actually a suburb of Liège,
was quite deserted, not a living being was to be
seen. I entered shops and cafés, called at the top
of my voice, but got no reply anywhere. I was
inclined to believe that everybody had fled. And
they would have been quite right too, for huge
columns of smoke rose up from the heights around
the place, four or five in a row, after a booming and
rolling peal like thunder had seemed to rend the sky.</p>

<p>The German artillery had taken up their positions
here, and bombarded the forts in their immediate
neighbourhood. These did not fail to answer, and
rained shells on the enemy's batteries. One heard
their hissing, which came nearer and nearer, until
they fell on the slopes or the tops of the hills and
burst with a terrific explosion. Many a time we
saw this happen only a few hundred yards away.
Then the air trembled, and I felt as if my legs were
blown from underneath me. Broken windows too
fell clattering on the "stoeps."</p>

<p>We entered another café, and once more I shouted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
for the inhabitants at the top of my voice. At last
I heard a feeble sound somewhere in the hall, which
I entered, but as I saw no one there, I called out
once more. Then I heard distinctly, and knew
whence the answer came. I opened a door, behind
which stairs led to the cellar, and from there I was
at last able to speak to some of the Herstal people.
I heard that all of them stayed in their cellars for
fear of the bombardment.</p>

<p>My request to allow the child to stay at the café
for half an hour was granted, and I went through
the village towards the place whence the German
batteries sent their destructive fire. At last I got
as far as the top of a hill, from which I could see
two forts shrouded in a cloud of smoke, which was
also the case with the German batteries.</p>

<p>I could not stop there long, for I was actually
within range. I saw a number of shells explode and
twice hit a farmhouse, which was destroyed for the
greater part. So I returned as quickly as possible
to my little protégée, and went on with her, following
the road as far as the canal, and then along
this to Maastricht.</p>

<p>On one of the hills, slightly to the south of
Haccourt, on the west bank of the Meuse and the
canal, a German battery was firing at Fort Pontisse.
The gunners there were quite kind, and they felt
no fear at all, for although they shelled the fort
continuously, it seemed that nothing was done by
way of reply to their fire. The shells from the fort
flew hissing over our heads, in the direction of
Lixhe, which proved that Fort Pontisse was still
chiefly busy with the pontoon-bridge at that place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span></p>

<p>Until now we had walked along the right bank
of the canal, until we crossed one of the many bridges.
The little girl was well-nigh exhausted; from time
to time I gave her a rest, and then again I carried
her a part of the way.</p>

<p>A good many soldiers were lying round about
the high cement factory of Haccourt. The factory
itself seemed to be used as a station for observations,
for suddenly a voice roared from a top window:
"Stop those people!" And we were stopped and
taken to a small table where three officers were
sitting drinking wine. The colonel asked for my
papers, which he did not consider sufficient, as I
had no passport from some German military
authority. So I drew out again the bridge-commander's
scrap of paper which said that I was
permitted to go from Lixhe to Visé.</p>

<p>"Is this then the road to Visé?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I am returning from there."</p>

<p>"Where then is Visé?"</p>

<p>"That way, sir!"</p>

<p>"That way? But how did you get here then?"</p>

<p>"You see, sir, the bridge across the Meuse has
been destroyed, and in order to get back I had to
walk first towards ... towards ... Liège ...
and ... and ... and then they ferried me over
somewhere down there, and told me that I had to
go along the canal to get to Maastricht."</p>

<p>"Is that so? Well, it is not very clear! And
that little girl?"</p>

<p>"That is a Netherland girl, sir, who was staying
at her aunt's at Liège ... I mean to say at Visé,
and whom I take now with me to Maastricht."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span></p>

<p>The officer went on shaking his head at my
answers, and I felt as if this might be the end of
my fine little adventure. But I could not tell him
that I had gone to Liège with that permit for Visé!</p>

<p>At Fort Pontisse or Lierce they seemed to have
noticed that the factory was a station for observation.
As the officer was still thinking about my case, one
of those infernal monster shells crashed down among
a group of soldiers, only some yards away. Those
who were not hit ran away, but they came back
soon, and took up seven or eight comrades, whom
they carried into the factory. I shuddered when
I saw what had happened, and through the shock
the sight gave me I involuntarily jerked my arms.</p>

<p>"Stand still!" the officer thundered.</p>

<p>He looked for a moment at the spot where the
deaths happened, from which the victims were
carried away, and then suddenly asked in a kinder
tone of voice:</p>

<p>"Is there any further news about the war in
The Netherlands?"</p>

<p>I saw that I must take advantage of his changed
mood and his curiosity, and I hastened to reply:</p>

<p>"Yes, that the French are advancing towards
Liège, and that the British have landed in Belgium."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"It is as I tell you!"</p>

<p>"But are you sure? Where are the French
now, and where did the British land?"</p>

<p>"Well, all the Netherland papers have extensive
official reports about it. The French are now at
Namur and the British landed troops at Ostend...."</p>

<p>"Wait! wait! wait!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span></p>

<p>Quickly he summoned an orderly and gave some
orders, and a few minutes later four more officers
drew round the table, on which a large map of
Belgium was displayed. Their tone became at
once charmingly sweet and kind, and a soldier
offered me some lemonade from small bottles kept
cool in a basin filled with cold water.</p>

<p>I did not feel very comfortable after what had
happened to those soldiers who lost their lives so
cruelly sudden, or in any case had been seriously
wounded, while the officers took little notice
of them. But it was desirable to behave as discreetly
as possible, and so to get a permit to
Maastricht.</p>

<p>I had to repeat everything about the advance
of the French and the landing of the British, whilst
they followed my story on the map. But I was
soon in a cold sweat, for of course I knew practically
nothing, neither of the French nor of the British,
and each time when one of the officers pressed for
details I was in mortal fear that I might contradict
myself. But I stuck to my guns until the end, and
assured them that the French had crossed the Belgian
frontier near Givet, and were now near Namur,
whereas the British, disembarking at Ostend, had
advanced as far as Ghent.</p>

<p>As soon as they had got all the information they
required, the commanding officer ordered a patrol
of cyclists of six men to leave their kit and rifles
behind, but to take a Browning, and deliver a
rapidly written letter at Liège.</p>

<p>They were now very friendly, and spoke even
with great kindliness about the Netherlanders in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
general. They let me proceed also on my way to
Maastricht, giving me their best wishes.</p>

<p>My little protégée was, however, soon very tired
and complained that her feet ached. I had to
carry her for nearly a mile and a half before we
arrived at the Netherland Custom House, where I
left her behind, as she was now safe. I went on to
Maastricht alone, wired to my paper, and then saw
the worried, but soon extremely happy parents of
the little girl. They went at once to the Netherland
frontier to take their child home.</p>

<p>I had succeeded. I had been in Liège, the first
foreign journalist who got there after her fall, and
was able to contradict the numerous reports about
the conquest of the forts which had made the round
of the newspapers for several days.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

ROUND ABOUT LIÈGE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the fights round the forts I made a good
many tours and was able to contradict several
German reports about alleged successes. The atrocities
in the villages around Liège did not cease,
and constantly fresh crowds of refugees came to
Maastricht.</p>

<p>In order to examine once more the state of affairs
around Liège, I decided to pay another visit to
that town.</p>

<p>Starting in the early morning of August 15th,
I arrived at Visé without much trouble, after having
been led across the Lixhe bridge once more. Since
my first visit the bridge had been destroyed three
times over, and this new one seemed very weak.
As I stood there looking at it, a motor lorry had to
cross it, and the bridge gave way near the bank.
Another motor had then to pull the lorry up to
the top of the bank, and this made the bridge give
way still further.</p>

<p>For the rest the transports were not much
troubled now, for obviously the bridge was no
longer the objective of the Belgian guns. At Visé
I was even told that Fort Pontisse had just been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
taken and only Lierce could harass the troops, who,
after crossing the bridge, advanced towards Tongeren.</p>

<p>Many things had happened at Visé since my first
visit. Under the pretext that the church spire
could indicate to Fort Pontisse in which direction
to shoot, paraffin had been poured over church
and spire and fire set to them. It was a venerable
ancient structure, built ten centuries ago, the fine
stained windows of which were well known.</p>

<p>The inhabitants looked upon the church as a
special sanctuary, as the bones of St. Hadelin were
kept there. Before the fire these relics had been
removed to the vicarage secretly, and then to St.
Hadelin College, the only large building that escaped
the general destruction next day.</p>

<p>Immediately after the church was set on fire,
the dean was arrested, as well as the burgomaster
and five reverend sisters. These last-mentioned
had been in prison a fortnight, when at last the
Germans discovered that the little sisters were of
German nationality. The Very Reverend Dean had
been treated very badly during his captivity.</p>

<p>There was dire want in the little town, for the
Germans had been requisitioning everything until
there was nothing left. And as during the first
days of the war all traffic had been stopped, it was
impossible to bring in fresh supplies. The pieces
of bread the people still had were like bricks, and
several days old; and yet I could not get any of it.</p>

<p>But the German troops had ample provisions for
themselves, and as an officer noticed that I went all
over the town to find some food in one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
restaurants, he offered me, the "friendly" Netherlander,
something to eat at the Guard House. This
I declined, however, for I could not have enjoyed
bread taken from the starving population.</p>

<p>There was still a real reign of terror, and constantly
the town-crier's bell was heard in the streets,
informing the people that the victors required
something or other. Only a few days ago it was
announced that all bicycles had to be delivered at
the bridge within twenty-four hours. Any person
who after that time was found in possession of
such a vehicle would be shot, and his house burned
down. With similar threats all arms were requisitioned,
but with the explicit addition that this
referred also to old, and broken arms, or those which
had been taken to pieces. Eatables and drinkables
were also constantly claimed under threats of arson.</p>

<p>From Visé I went again across the Meuse to the
road along the canal. Nearing Haccourt, I noticed
that Fort Pontisse was actually silent, but Lierce
still in full action. The Germans had mounted
long-range guns on the hills between Lancey and
Haccourt, whence they could place Fort Lierce
under fire. A German officer, after some coaxing,
allowed me to witness the operations for a short
time. I found a place near some heavy guns, and
sat down amid some underwood. The shooting
from Lierce was very fierce, but only by the plumes
of smoke could I tell whereabouts the fort might be.
The shells came down near us, but during the
half hour of my stop not one made a hit. They all
fell short of us.</p>

<p>It was a cruel sight. At a tolerably quick pace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
hundreds of soldiers marched out in the direction
of the fort, dragging light ordnance with them.
One of the officers explained to me that the big
guns could not yet operate here; and now a
division of foot-artillery was commanded to occupy
a small hill near the fort. The big guns had to
support them on the way. The guns roared as if
all the thunderbolts of heaven had been flung into
space. The smoke of the powder poisoned the air
and made me cough. Gradually my surroundings
were enveloped in a thin haze, which became denser
and more suffocating the longer the guns roared.
And at last those hundreds of men, dragging their
guns along the byways, looked merely like shades.</p>

<p>For quite a quarter of an hour they seemed to
proceed successfully, as obviously not one shell
exploded in their neighbourhood. But suddenly
all along their line dark masses several yards high
rose up. This was the effect of numerous exceedingly
well-aimed shells on the dry, loose sand. Soon
the men were surrounded by those thick clouds of
dust, and only during the first few minutes I saw
here and there one of those shades in human form
tumble down, evidently hit by one of the projectiles.
Then I saw nothing for a long while, excepting
the thick wall of dust, which seemed to remain
standing up, for constantly the shells threw up
anew the earth that had only just fallen down.</p>

<p>The dust-wall extended gradually as the distance
grew covered by the Germans in their flight to
their former positions. But at last we saw the first
men emerge in complete disorder from that driving
cloud. Some on the right, others on the left, here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
and there also small groups which courageously
dragged their guns with them, as they saved themselves
from that infernal downpour.</p>

<p>Five minutes later the smoke had disappeared
almost, and I was able to see what had happened
on the field in front of me. Terrible! On all sides
lay scattered the lads, who but a short time ago
started with so much enthusiasm, and here and
there a gun knocked over, five, six corpses lying
around it.</p>

<p>In front of me, behind me, on all sides, the guns
boomed, clouds of dust and smoke filled the air,
making it impossible to see much, which made the
awe and terror endurable; but after the air became
clear again, and the sun shed glowing light on the
beautiful fields, it was terrible to think that all
those dots in the plain were the bodies of young
men, cruelly crushed by the infernal products of
human ingenuity. It was agony to see here and
there a body rising up, merely to fall down again
immediately, or an arm waving as if invoking help.</p>

<p>And by my side stood officers and soldiers raging
and cursing. To them came the returning men,
blood running along their faces from insignificant
wounds, and they bawled and bellowed, and thundered
with a thousand curses that they wanted to go
back and try again. How ghastly they rolled their
eyes in frenzied excitement! Some pointing at me
asked the officer who I was, and he explained.
Then I had to listen to endless imprecations against
the civilian population of Belgium, who, according
to them, consisted entirely of francs-tireurs, who
all of them deserved to be shot, and to have their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
houses burned down. To repeat the coarse words
which they sputtered out in their rage would only
cause disgust.</p>

<p>The officer assured me that a new effort would be
made soon, as they were commanded to take Pontisse
and Lierce at any price, the seventh and ninth
regiment of foot-artillery of Cologne being selected
for the purpose.</p>

<p>I did not want to witness that second attack, and,
after thanking the officer, resumed my journey
along the canal-road to Liège.</p>

<p>Near Herstal the Germans were crossing by the
large bridge, which the Belgians had preserved to
their own disadvantage.</p>

<p>In Liège things were no longer so depressing as at
the time of my first visit. There was some traffic
in the streets, and by order of the German authorities
the shops had been reopened.</p>

<p>In a meadow east of the city I saw three big guns
mounted, the biggest I had seen as yet. They
kept up a continuous and powerful cannonade at the
forts near the town, that had not yet been taken.
There were three of them left, of which Loncin
was the most important.</p>

<p>A little farther away they were still busy with
Lierce, but excepting these four, all the forts were
now taken by the Germans. I stood there for a
moment, gazing at these cannon, the presence of
which was clearly unknown to the Belgians, for
their artillery took no notice of them. Only the
day before these guns had started shelling the forts,
and on the evening of August 15th they had silenced
two of them; but Loncin kept up the fight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span></p>

<p>During the evening I was granted an audience
by the Right Reverend Monseigneur Rutten,
Bishop of Liège. The venerable, aged prelate
received me very affably, but he was deeply impressed
by the terrible fate that had overwhelmed his poor
native country. He himself had suffered exceedingly
bad treatment at the hands of the Germans. First
he and the other hostages were imprisoned in the
citadel, where he was locked up in a small shanty,
with a leaking roof, so that the torrential rain entered
it freely. Wet and cold, the Bishop passed that day
without being offered any food, and, as stated above,
was at last allowed to go home.</p>

<p>He told me a good many other instances of ill-treatment,
but as I gave him my word of honour
not to mention them, my mouth is sealed. He
himself was visited a few days later by the German
commanding general, who offered his apologies.</p>

<p>That same evening many more houses were burned
down, more particularly in Outre-Meuse, although
no valid reason was given for that.</p>

<p>The next day, Sunday, August 16th, I was already
about at five o'clock in the morning, and soon witnessed
some historical shots. In the park on one
of the boulevards the Germans had been digging
for two days, and prepared a firm foundation upon
which big guns might be mounted. I saw one of
these guns that morning, and at about half-past
five three shots were fired from it at short intervals,
by which Fort Loncin was completely destroyed, as
was indicated by the terrific explosions which followed
the third shot. After these shots I was quite
benumbed for several minutes; in all the streets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
of Liège they caused the greatest commotion, which
became all the greater because large numbers of
cavalry happened to ride through the town, and all
the horses started rearing.</p>

<p>Was the gun I had seen there one of the notorious
forty-two centimetre monsters? I should not like
to wager my head in affirming that. It was an inordinately
unwieldy and heavy piece of ordnance,
but during the first days of the war nothing or very
little had yet been said or written about these forty-two's,
and I did not pay sufficient attention to the
one I saw. Only after the fall of Loncin did
all those articles about the forty-two's appear
in the papers, and the Germans certainly asserted
that they destroyed Loncin by means of such a
cannon.</p>

<p>But it is equally certain that at Liège as well as
at Namur and Antwerp the Austrian thirty-point-five
mortars were used, siege-guns chiefly, and these
were taken by the German soldiers for forty-two's.
These Austrian mortars were equally misnamed in
German, French, and even Netherland illustrated
papers.</p>

<p>However, the effect of these Austrian mortars
was terrible enough. I could not form a correct
opinion about them by the sound of the shot; and
only those who were in the fort that was hit were
able to realise the terrific results. Hence the
interest of the report by an officer, who escaped
after having been made a prisoner at Loncin. He
told my colleague of <i>De Tijd</i> at Antwerp about it.
After having related how, during nearly ten days,
the fort had been defended heroically and reso<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>lutely,
he gave the following description of the
final struggle:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On August 14th, at about four o'clock in the afternoon,
the expected storm burst; for twenty-five hours the
invisible siege-guns poured their torrent of projectiles on the
fort. Flares of fire and dense clouds of smoke belched through
the crevices. As the enemy's batteries could not be located,
their fire could not be answered. The artillerists of the
garrison were then taken to the spacious chief gallery, which
offered a safe refuge under its vault, about two and a half to
three yards thick. Outside the sentries were watching. In
the parts near the entrance it was unendurable; the heavy
projectiles from the guns mounted in the town had nibbled
away the outer wall, only a yard and a half thick. There
were as yet no casualties among the garrison; calmly they
waited for the infernal tempest to subside and the enemy to
storm the fort, for they had sworn to repulse the assault.</p>

<p>"General Leman, Commander Naessens, and all the officers
were splendid in their imperturbable courage. They found
the words that went straight to the hearts of their men.
These fellows looked more like bronze statues than human
beings. The projectiles hammered at the walls and smashed
huge pieces, penetrating into the parts near the entrance.
The rest of the fort withstood splendidly the hurricane of
hostile steel and fire. During the night the bombardment
stopped, and then the commanding officer went to inspect
the cupolas.</p>

<p>"The larger ones had suffered little; but the majority
were jammed by fragments of concrete and steel, which struck
between the armour and the front-armour. The small
quick-fire cupolas had not been touched by any projectile.
'It is all right,' he said, 'we shall be able to repulse the enemy's
attack.'</p>

<p>"At dawn the bombardment started again, but only the
front was seriously damaged. The garrison stood as firm as
a rock. Here and there the beginnings of a fire were soon
extinguished.</p>

<p>"Then a frightful thing happened. The men had finished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
breakfast, some were sleeping quietly in spite of the thundering
noise. The assault was expected to commence during the
next night.</p>

<p>"And then the disaster followed suddenly. At about five
o'clock a tremendous explosion shook the fort to the foundations;
the powder-magazine had caught fire. It is impossible
to describe the appalling results of that explosion; the entire
middle-part of the fort collapsed in a stupendous cloud of
flames, smoke and dust; it was an awful destruction, an
immense avalanche of masses of concrete, fragments of armour,
which in their fall crushed to death nearly the whole of the
garrison. From this fantastical, confused mass, overwhelming
clouds of suffocating smoke escaped through some crevices and
holes.</p>

<p>"After this infernal rumble, deadly silence followed,
interrupted only by the groans of the wounded. The German
artillery ceased to fire, and from all sides their infantry came
rushing on, their faces expressing the terror caused by such
great calamities. They were no longer soldiers longing to
destroy, but human beings hurrying to go to the assistance
of other human beings.</p>

<p>"German sappers and other military men cleared away
the dead and the wounded. They also discovered General
Leman, whose orderlies, who had a miraculous escape from
death, were already busy in rescuing him from underneath
the ruins.</p>

<p>"They were all unrecognisable, their faces were black
from smoke, their uniforms in rags, their hands covered with
blood. The general was put on a stretcher, and carried outside
the fort across the heaps of obstacles; there he was
attended to by a surgeon. He had lost consciousness. As
soon as he recovered it, he pressed the hands of two Belgian
officers. 'It is all over; there is nothing left to defend. But
we did our utmost courageously.'</p>

<p>"A German officer came nearer, and, uncovering his head,
said in a voice trembling with emotion: 'General, what you
performed is admirable!' Evidently these words slightly
comforted the defender of Liège, who before long was removed
by motor-car to an ambulance in the town."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span></p>

<p>Such was the end of Fort Loncin, and by its fall
the last obstacle was removed by which the undisturbed
progress of the German armies might have
been prevented. The brave defenders of Loncin
did not surrender, but stood their ground until they
were buried under the ruins of their own defences.
According to information from another source,
Lierce had succumbed the night before.</p>

<p>Early next morning I walked through the streets
of Liège, dull and depressed, deploring the fact
that such clumsy, heavy iron monsters had been
able to crush this stout defence and such men. As
I reached the Place du Marché, there arrived three
hundred disarmed Belgian warriors, escorted by
a strong German force. They stopped in the
square, and soon hundreds of the people of Liège
crowded around them. They were the defenders of
Fort Pontisse.</p>

<p>Men and women tried to break through the German
cordon, but were repulsed roughly. So they
threw fruit, cigars, and cigarettes at them. The
lads looked gratefully at their compatriots, but for
the rest stared in front of them in dismal depression.
Once and again a name was called, as a relative or
friend was recognised. Some shed tears.</p>

<p>Whether neutral or foreigner, no one could help
being deeply moved. Men and women, boys and
girls, pressed once more through the German fence,
just to shake hands with someone they had recognised.
No wailing followed, but when hands were
gripped, with a suppressed sob, they said:</p>

<p>"Bear up, lad! Keep courage; it will soon be
different."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span></p>

<p>And the answer was:</p>

<p>"We did our utmost to the last, but it was impossible
to go on."</p>

<p>I could not help myself, but also pressed through
the Germans, as I wanted to exchange a few words
with the Belgians. This was possible for a very
few moments only, in which they told me that they
had been firing night and day in order to harass
the Germans who crossed the river, but they had to
yield at the end, when the Germans put Belgian
civilians in front of themselves when attacking the
fort.</p>

<p>I was roughly pushed back by the German soldiers
twice over. I broke through only to be repulsed
again. They got into difficulties with the huge
crowd, who pushed through on all sides, bought up
the stock of surrounding shops, and threw chocolates
and other sweets, cigars and cigarettes, at their
boys. Then a bugle sounded, and the Belgians
once more were arrayed in files. They calmly
lighted their cigarettes, and as the order "march"
was given, they took off their caps, waved them
through the air, and, turning to the Liège crowd,
exclaimed: "Vive la Belgique." Then hundreds
of caps, hats, and arms were waved in response, the
air resounding the cry: "Vive la Belgique. Au
revoir! Au revoir!"</p>

<p>As I felt myself one with the population, I uncovered
my head and enthusiastically joined in the
cry: "Au revoir! Au revoir!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When I was half way between Liège and the
Netherland frontier, I noticed that the village of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
Vivignes was burning in various places. It is a
beautiful spot, quite concealed between the green
trees on the slope of the hills, west of the canal.
And the finest and largest farms were exactly those
ablaze. The fire crackled fiercely, roofs came down
with a crash and a thud. Not a living being could
be seen. From the windows of the burning houses
small white flags hung, and they too were one by
one destroyed by the fire. I counted forty-five
farms that were burning, destroyed by the raging
flames.</p>

<p>In a café, lower down, near the canal I saw a
number of German soldiers, and was successful in
having a chat with the inn-keeper, at the farthest
corner of the bar. I asked him, of course, what they
meant by burning the village, and he told me that
the Germans had made a number of unsuccessful
attacks on Fort Pontisse, until at last they reduced
it to silence. They were now so near that they
could open the final assault. They were afraid,
however, of some ambush, or underground mine,
and the Friday before they had collected the population,
whom they forced to march in front of them.
When they had got quite near they dared not enter
it yet, and drove the priest and twelve of the
principal villagers before them. That is how
Pontisse was conquered.</p>

<p>Later on I heard the same story from several
other inhabitants.</p>

<p>The people had been in deadly terror, and women
and old men, fearing that they would be killed,
had fallen on their knees beseeching the soldiers to
spare them. At present many women and old men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
and even strong men, were laid up with violent
feverish attacks of nerves.</p>

<p>Only because these wretched people had not
promptly obeyed the order of the military to march
against the fort in front of the soldiers, Vivignes
had been punished, and that morning over forty
of the best houses had been set on fire.</p>

<p>I shuddered at the thought that in these days
such barbarities were possible. I asked the soldiers
whether I was allowed to enter the burning village,
but the commanding sergeant refused his
consent.</p>

<p>I also asked the inn-keeper whether he felt no fear
in those surroundings. But, shrugging his shoulders,
he answered: "All we can do is to wait quietly. I
do all in my power to keep them in a good temper,
give them beer and cigars, and yesterday killed one
of my two cows for them. I may have lost everything
at the end of the war, ... but even so, let
it be, if I can only save the life of my family and keep
a roof over my head. But my anxiety is great
enough, for, you understand, I have two daughters
... and ... and...."</p>

<p>We had got near the door of the room that stood
ajar, and from there came the sound of a couple of
girls' voices: "Hail, Mary.... Hail, Mary...."</p>

<p>The frightened maidens were saying their
rosary.</p>

<p>The news, that all the forts had now been taken
was quickly communicated to the surrounding
military posts, and in consequence the soldiers were
in a wanton mood. Most of the houses which I
passed had their doors and windows smashed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
broken, but the most provoking was that soldiers
had compelled the people in the cafés along the
canal to open their pianos and make their musical
automatons play. To the tunes of these instruments
they danced, yelling and shouting. No
greater contrast was imaginable than that between
such scenes and the burning village with the frightened
inhabitants around it.</p>

<p>Near Haccourt, by the bank of the Meuse, I
noticed a terrible glare of fire and dense smoke. It
was an alarming sight, and made me fear the direst
things. I considered for a moment whether I
should go there or not, fearing that I had already
taxed my nerves too much. Yet, I made up my
mind to go, and by a side-way got to the Meuse,
near Visé. German engineers were busy here laying
telephone wires, and an officer stopped me, threatening
me with his revolver. It was obvious that they
were no longer accustomed to see civilians on that
road. After having examined my passport and
seeing that I was a Netherland journalist, he became
very friendly, and politely urged me not to go
farther.</p>

<p>"Why not, sir?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Well, there is a huge fire yonder; everything is
burning!"</p>

<p>"How did that come about?"</p>

<p>"Well, it seems that the civilians cannot understand
that only soldiers may fight soldiers, and
for that reason the whole place has been set on
fire."</p>

<p>"Devant-le-Pont?"</p>

<p>"No, Visé."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span></p>

<p>"Visé? Do you mean to say, sir, that the whole of
Visé has been set on fire?"</p>

<p>"Certainly!"</p>

<p>"But ... but ...! May I go there?"</p>

<p>"I must advise you not to, for it is extremely
dangerous, but if you like...."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir, then I shall go there!"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

VISÉ DESTROYED: A PREMEDITATED
CRIME</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the first things I have to deal with is also
one of the most fearful I ever saw, and I only hope
that I may never again witness the like of it.</p>

<p>I have mentioned already the reign of terror with
which the Germans ruled the wretched townlet
ever since they entered it. Something fateful might
happen any moment, and actually occurred during
the night of August 15th and 16th.</p>

<p>On that evening the soldiers, rough fellows from
East Prussia, had been revelling in the cafés, shouting
filthy ditties in the streets, and most of them in a
very advanced state of intoxication. At ten o'clock
suddenly a shot was heard. The fellows took their
rifles, which they had placed against the walls, or on
the tables of the cafés, and ran into the street shouting
in a mad rage: "They have been shooting!"
The most tipsy began to shoot at doors and windows
simultaneously in various parts of the town, which
made the people in the houses scream, and this
excited the mad drunken soldiers all the more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
They forced their way into several houses, knocking
down the frightened inhabitants when these tried
to stop them.</p>

<p>It is stated that some of the wretched people
were even pinioned and beaten. Their assailants
then stumbled up the stairs and began to shoot
wildly from the upper stories into the dark streets,
where their own raving comrades were rushing
about like madmen. Some civilians who in great
fear had come to their front door to see what was
happening were shot down.</p>

<p>After this game had been going on for some time,
the order was given: "Everybody must come
outside." Doors and windows were forced open
and broken, and men, women, and children driven
out of the houses. They were at once ruthlessly
separated. Men who assisted their aged mothers,
or carried their little babies, were taken away
from their families, and driven away, leaving
their wailing and weeping wives and children
behind, while the flames from burning houses
threw a lurid light on the sad scenes of that
terrible evening.</p>

<p>The poor wretches, who expected to be killed
at any moment, were driven into squares or the
meadows, where they were exposed to the chilly
night air, so that several babies perished. Only
the next morning were the women and children
allowed to leave&mdash;that is to say, they were told to
take the shortest way to Maastricht.</p>

<p>A number of the men were taken to Germany,
the others were kept as prisoners in the neighbourhood,
and by and by had to suffer the shame of being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
compelled to work for the enemy. Amongst them
were men who had never done any manual work,
such as an aged notary public.</p>

<p>Even a doctor of the Red Cross established at
St. Hadelin College had been removed in his white
overall and wearing his Red Cross armlet. This
was Dr. Labye, who already had rendered signal
services to the wounded Germans. In consequence
of his detention twenty of them were left in the
hospital without medical attendance....</p>

<p>During the night only a few houses were burnt
down; the general destruction followed the next
morning, Sunday, August 16th, and just as I reached
the little town the flames were raging all over the
place in a fierce blaze.</p>

<p>I shall never forget that sight. The Meuse
separated me from the raging blaze on the opposite
bank. The flames roared violently, roofs and rafters
and walls crashed down, and the wood of living
trees was burning and screeching loudly. I saw
but a sea of fire, one glaring glow, and the air was
scorchingly hot. A light breeze blew through the
place, and made clouds of smoke to whirl through
the streets like avalanches of snow. The view down
the longer streets leading straight from the hill-tops
to the Meuse was very fantastic.</p>

<p>The wind seemed to play with the smoke, rolling
dense volumes down the slopes which dispersed
only when they reached the bank along the river.
Whilst the flames soared high up from the roofs,
the walls of the houses stood still erect, and everywhere
in the windows one saw those miserable
little white flags, symbols of submission, mute prayers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
that submission should be rewarded by sparing the
life and possession of the inhabitants....</p>

<p>I stood near the spot where the ferry-boat used
to take people across; but to cross was now out of
the question, for any one alighting on the opposite
side would be landed in the scorching glare. Therefore,
I returned to Lixhe, where I might try to cross
the river by the pontoon-bridge, and get to Visé
along the other bank of the Meuse.</p>

<p>On the way I was stopped by two soldiers, one
of whom examined my papers, and, finding that I
was a journalist, revealed himself as a colleague, in
ordinary times editor of the <i>Kölnische Zeitung</i>.
He shook both my hands quite excitedly, glad to
meet a colleague, and, better still, one from the
"friendly" Netherlands.</p>

<p>I had to listen to a prolonged hymn of praise of
the <span class="err" title="original: Netherlander">Netherlanders</span>, who were such sensible people,
and the best friends of the Germans; protestations
which did not interest me in the least at that
moment. On the contrary, it struck me as deplorable
that this man did not say a single word of his
own accord about the horrible thing happening
close by: the destruction of an entire community!
He did not seem to attach any importance to it....</p>

<p>As soon as the "friendly" Netherlander thought
that he had swallowed sufficient praise, I began to
ask questions about the meaning of that wanton
devastation, and why it was inflicted on the population!
Before answering, he looked round in a casual
manner, as if thinking: "Oh, it's that bit of fire
you refer to!" And then exploded in a string of
imprecations against the population.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span></p>

<p>It is a lamentable sign that this German, probably
well educated, had not taken the slightest trouble
to find out the reason for this wholesale wrecking
of a town, that the whole affair impressed him so
little. "Somebody" had said that those cursed
civilians had been shooting, that explained it to his
satisfaction, and gave him ample cause for coarse
abuse of the wretched people.</p>

<p>How many soldiers had fallen in consequence of
this attack by francs-tireurs he knew not; which
troops had witnessed the occurrence he could not
say. All he did know was that these troops had left
in the morning, leaving a small force behind to impose
the punishment.</p>

<p>The bridge-command at the pontoon-bridge near
Lixhe allowed me to cross, after requesting me very
pressingly to make <i>very clear</i> what swine these
Belgians were, who fired so treacherously at unsuspecting
soldiers, put out the eyes of the wounded,
cut off their hands and genitals. When I asked
where all these things had happened, the answer
was: "Everywhere!" Of course, I promised
them to do everything they wanted.</p>

<p>Very large divisions marched from Visé to the
pontoon bridge in the direction of Tongres. After
the Liège forts had been taken the bridge might be
passed in perfect safety. All day long troops came
along that road without interruption. I could
quite see that the soldiers who were at Visé the
previous day, and brought about the conflagration,
were gone, for they had left their traces
behind. All along the road lay parts of bicycles,
shoes, instruments, toys, and so on, everything new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
and evidently looted from the shops. Very valuable
things were among them, everything crushed
and smashed by the cavalry horses, the clumsy
munition and forage waggons, or the heavy wheels
of the guns.</p>

<p>A little farther on a few houses were left undamaged,
because they stood outside the town
proper. A woman who had remained in her house
stood outside with cigar-boxes under her arm.
She offered cigars from an open box to the soldiers
of the passing divisions. To me she seemed to be
out of her mind, as she stood there trembling, her
face distorted from hypernervousness. Her cringing
kindness was of no avail, for I noticed a couple of
days afterwards that her house too had been totally
destroyed.</p>

<p>On the first houses of the town large bills had
been stuck, intimating that they were a Netherlander's
property, but obviously that had not
impressed the tipsy soldiers to any extent, for they
had been wrecked all the same for the greater
part.</p>

<p>The whole town was like a sea of fire. The
Germans, who are nothing if not thorough, even
in the matter of arson, had worked out their scheme
in great detail. In most houses they had poured
some benzine or paraffin on the floor, put a lighted
match to it, and thrown a small black disc, the size
of a farthing, on the burning spot, and then immediately
the flames flared up with incredible fury. I
do not know the constituents of this particular
product of "Kultur."</p>

<p>Nor did I see any inhabitants in the burning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
town. It was practically impossible to stay in the
streets; burning walls and roofs and gutters crashed
down with a great noise, so that the streets were as
much on fire as the houses themselves. Only at
the crossings were any soldiers to be seen, who, in
various stages of intoxication, constantly aimed at
the burning houses, and shot everything that tried
to escape from the burning stables and barns: pigs,
horses, cows, dogs, and so on.</p>

<p>Suddenly I saw a boy about twelve years old in
one of the burning streets. He waved his arms,
rushed madly to and fro, calling for his father and
mother, and his little brother and sisters. He
was in danger of perishing in the fire, or being killed
by the murderous bullet from a rifle. I ran after
him, laid hold of him, and in spite of his resistance
pulled him back. Fortunately I met a couple of kind,
sober soldiers to whom I told the story, and who
promised to send the boy away from the burning
town.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards I met a Netherland Red Cross
motor-car. The male nurses, who had met me
already on former occasions during the war, recognised
me, rushed up to me, and forced me to come
with them to the car. Here they tried to explain
with a torrential flow of words that I exposed
myself to the greatest danger by coming here, as
nearly all the soldiers were drunk, shot at every
civilian, and so on.</p>

<p>They insisted upon my staying near the car, and
be a little safer under the protection of the Red
Cross. They told me how they had to drag an old
woman out of her house, who refused to come with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
them, and in her despair shouted nothing but:
"Let me die!&mdash;let me die!"</p>

<p>I could not say or do anything, for I felt as if
stunned, and let them lead me where they liked; so
they gave me a glass of claret, and that revived me.</p>

<p>A few moments after they went away I went also,
and entered the burning town once more. A Netherland
family lived in Villa Rustica, and I had promised
to make inquiries about them.</p>

<p>As I stood there looking at the ruins of what was
once so fine a house, a small group of refugees approached,
carrying as usual their miserable parcels in
which they had hurriedly collected the things that
had the least value. As they saw me they shuddered
and shivered and crept closer together. Most of
them wept and sobbed, and their faces were twisting
nervously.</p>

<p>I went up to them and explained that there was
no need at all to be afraid of me. They were able to
give me news of the inhabitants of Villa Rustica.
The owner had died a few days since, from a paralytic
stroke, brought on by the emotions caused by
the German horrors, whereas madame, who had
heroically intervened on behalf of some victims,
was probably at St. Hadelin College.</p>

<p>My poor informants had not yet made up their
mind where to go, fearing that they might not be
permitted to enter The Netherlands as they were
without means of subsistence. I assured them,
however, that our conception of neighbourly love
and charity was different, and that they would be
hospitably received.</p>

<p>I showed them the way to Eysden, and they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
scarcely started when a cavalry patrol came racing
on, the men tipsy and their seat rather unstable.
Seeing the refugees, they aimed their rifles at them
and roared "Hands up!" The poor creatures not
only put up their hands, but fell on their knees,
and muttered incoherent words. The women
folded their hands, and stretched them out to the
cavalry, as if praying for mercy. The soldiers
looked at the scene for a moment, burst out in a
harsh laughter, spurred on their horses, and raced
on without a word. Two of them stopped near
me. I gave them, however, no time for threats,
but quickly showed them the old pass to Visé.
As soon as they saw the German writing they said:
"All right!" and went off.</p>

<p>I came now to the eastern boundary of the town,
whence the streets slope gently towards the bank
of the Meuse. Here I had an atrociously fantastic
view of the burning mass of houses. I fell in with
a crowd of dead-drunk soldiers, who first handed
my papers on from the one to the other, but as
soon as they understood that I was a Netherlander
they showed no hostility.</p>

<p>They sang and shouted and waved their arms.
Most of them carried bottles full of liquor, which
they put to their mouths frequently, smashed them
on the ground, or handed them to their comrades,
when unable to drink any more themselves. Each
of a troop of cavalry had a bottle of pickles, and
enjoyed them immensely.</p>

<p>Other soldiers kept on running into the burning
houses, carrying out vases, pictures, plate, or small
pieces of furniture. They smashed everything on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
the cobbles and then returned to wreck more
things that would have been destroyed by the
fire all the same. It was a revelry of drunken
vandalism. They seemed mad, and even risked
being burned alive at this work of destruction.
Most of the officers were also tipsy; not one of them
was saluted by the soldiers.</p>

<p>The beastly scenes which I witnessed in the
glaring, scorching heat benumbed me, and I looked
on vacantly for a long time. At last I went back and
called at St. Hadelin College, the Head of which I
had visited already once or twice. The building
was still undamaged.</p>

<p>As soon as the Reverend Head, Dr. Frits Goffin,
saw me he burst out sobbing, and, taking me by
the hand, speechless, he pressed it a long time. I
myself also was quite dumb. At length he
muttered:</p>

<p>"Could you ever have thought ... that ...
that ... such ... a cruel ... fate would overwhelm
us? What crime did these poor people
commit? Have we not given all we had? Have we
not strictly obeyed their commands? Have we not
done more than they asked for? Have we not
charitably nursed their wounded in this House?
Oh! they profess deep gratitude to me. But ...
why then? There is nothing left in the House for
the aged refugees whom we admitted, for the
soldiers we nurse; our doctor has been made a
prisoner and taken away, and we are without
medical help. This is nothing for the Sisters and
myself, but all these unfortunate creatures ...
they must have food...."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span></p>

<p>The excellent man went on weeping, and I was
not able to console him and did not know what to
say. He took my arm, and led me to the large
common hall, where twenty wounded Germans lay,
who had been hit in the fight for the forts. He
went to one bed after the other, and, with tears
in his eyes, asked each man how he felt, and inquired,
"Are you ... properly ... cared for ... here?
Are you?" The sick men turned round, their
eyes beamed, and they stammered words full of
gratitude. Others said nothing, but took the Head's
hand and pressed it long and warmly.</p>

<p>The wounded civilians had been put up in the
small schoolrooms. Some of them must soon
die. Some had burns, but most of them were
hit the previous night during the mad outbreak,
the mad shooting of the drunken and riotous
Germans. In another room a number of old
women were crowded together, who had to fly
but could not walk all the way to the Netherland
frontier.</p>

<p>Near each staircase stood a blackboard on which
the Germans had written that to go upstairs was
prohibited under penalty of death. The Head
explained that the Germans alleged that light
signals had been given from the top storey.</p>

<p>Two South-American boys, about twelve years
old, had stayed on and heroically assisted the Head
at his charitable work. Dr. Goffin was not allowed
to take anybody with him except these two children
in his search for the wounded, and to bury the
dead. It is scarcely credible how courageously
these boys of such tender age behaved. Later the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
Chilean ambassador made inquiries about them
and asked for their portraits.</p>

<p>I also met there a compatriot, who had got permission
to go to The Netherlands, but declined to
leave. She was Mrs. de Villers, <i>née</i> Borret. On
August 27th I wrote about her to <i>De Tijd</i>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Four days ago her husband was buried. As he was
addressing the League of Old-Retraitants at Cherath he was
seized by a paralytic stroke, which proved fatal. She has
no longer a home, beautiful Villa Rustica being completely
burnt out, and now in ruins. But she refuses to return to
The Netherlands, as she is still able to be of service to the
people here.</p>

<p>"In Cherath she saved the life of a good many. As it was
alleged that there had been shooting, the priest, the chaplain,
a retired priest, eighty years old, the mayor, and several leading
citizens were condemned to be shot. None, not even the
priest, was able to defend himself, as they knew not a word
of German, and could not make themselves understood.
Mrs. de Villers, who speaks German fluently, explained that
the spot where the shooting was alleged to have taken place
was not part of Cherath at all.</p>

<p>"So this brave lady succeeded in getting the sentence of
death withdrawn. But the Germans wanted to torture their
wretched prisoners on any or no plea. They were placed
near the church wall, kept standing there all night, were told
that they would be shot by and by, and threatened by the
soldiers with their bayonets.</p>

<p>"In the morning sixty soldiers escorted them out of the
village to the hamlet Wandre, where the populace was told
they would be shot. Should one shot be fired by one of the
inhabitants&mdash;thus Mrs. de Villers was told&mdash;the prisoners
would be shot out of hand; if not, they would be released at
Wandre. Mrs. de Villers had, of course, secretly warned the
inhabitants in time.</p>

<p>"She hopes to be able to render further services to the
populace, thanks to her knowledge of German, and stays on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
occupying her time with charitable work. A respectful salute
is due to this courageous compatriot."</p></blockquote>

<p>On the same day I wrote as follows about Dr.
Goffin:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"His face, unshaven since ever so long, is quite emaciated,
and presents all the symptoms of nervous exhaustion. Once
more twenty German soldiers are being nursed in his college,
where only once a German doctor came to see them. He
(Dr. Goffin) and a couple of Sisters have to manage everything
by themselves, and the Germans do not even dream of
providing food for their own wounded, although the college
is so inadequately provisioned that the Head and the Sisters
have to deny themselves the necessary nourishment that they
may feed the wounded.</p>

<p>"And how are they thanked for it?</p>

<p>"The Reverend Head has been notified already ten times
that he would be shot, and he is frequently being arrested for
alleged shooting from the building. This shooting is actually
done by German soldiers alone, who are loafing and looting,
as I myself noticed a short time ago. The Head took me to
a room where an old man of ninety, who had just received the
extreme unction, lay dying. By his side sat a broken-hearted
little old woman, his wife. This old man had been taken
prisoner with other men of Visé, and forced to work at a new
bridge. The poor fellow broke down under the strain; it
cost him his life."</p></blockquote>

<p>I left burning Visé deeply impressed by the
savage scenes I had witnessed: men turned into
beasts by drink, passion, and anger, doing all manner
of wrong to the wretched inhabitants; but the
impression became deeper by the great contrast:
the perfect, charitable devotion of a virtuous priest,
a courageous lady, and ever kind and commiserate
Sisters. Never have I experienced so many emotions
in one day as at Visé.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span></p>

<p>After taking warm leave of the Head of St.
Hadelin College, I continued my walk to the
Netherland frontier.</p>

<p>I was scarcely outside the townlet when I met
another little group of refugees, probably all
members of one family. The mother was being
supported by her daughters, all wept, and nervous
exhaustion made them totter as they walked.
Every moment the mother looked back pitifully at
the conflagration which devoured all around, including
her slender property, for which she had
worked so many years.</p>

<p>From the other side came two soldiers, one of
whom she recognised, as he had been billeted on
her. Constantly weeping, her face distorted, she
sent another glance towards that fiery blaze, looked
at the soldier as if reprovingly, hesitated a moment,
but then pressed the enemy's hand, sobbing:
"Adieu!&mdash;adieu!"</p>

<p>Sometimes I felt as if I were dreaming and wanted
to call myself back from this nightmare to another,
better, and real world. And I thought constantly
of the man who, by one word, had given the order
for these murders, this arson; the man who severed
husbands and fathers, wives and mothers, and
children, who caused so many innocent people to
be shot, who destroyed the results of many, many
years of strict economy and strenuous industry.</p>

<p>The first acquaintance whom I met on Netherland
territory was a Netherland lady married to a
Walloon, who kept a large café at Visé. Before
the destruction she had asked me, full of anxiety,
whether the Germans would indeed carry out their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
threat and wreck everything. I had comforted
her, and answered that I did not think them capable
of doing such a thing. Weeping, she came to me,
and reminded me of my words. The whole business,
in which these young people had invested their
slender capital, had been wrecked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

FRANCS-TIREURS?</h2>

<p>I <small>THINK</small> that there is no better occasion to deal with
the question whether there was a franc-tireur-guerilla
in Belgium than after the chapter on the
destruction of Visé.</p>

<p>My opinion on the matter is still the same as
when I first wrote about it to <i>De Tijd</i>, and in <i>Vrij
België</i>; and from my own personal knowledge and
after mixing with the people I consider the allegation
that the Belgians acted as francs-tireurs an
absolute lie.</p>

<p>Some uphold the accusation on the ground of
expressions in Belgian newspapers, collected in a
German pamphlet. In my opinion these quotations
have not the slightest value. Everyone will understand
this who thinks of the excitement of journalists,
whose country was suddenly and quite unexpectedly
involved in a terrible war, and who felt now that
as journalists they had to perform a great, patriotic
duty. In their nervous, over-excited condition
they sat at their desk and listened to the gossip of
refugees about civilians taking part in the struggle.
In their imagination they saw hordes of barbarians
overrun their native soil, saw man and man, woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
and woman, shoulder to shoulder, resisting the
invader without regard for their own life. The
thoughts of such journalists, whose very own country
had been at war now for a few days, were not on
severe logical lines; they found a certain beauty
in that picture, and I can quite understand how
some came to believe in it as a reality, and gloried
in it.</p>

<p>That is not evidence however, for how did they
get the information? From my own experience
I make bold to say with the greatest confidence
that these reports came from German sources only,
whereas there was not any ground for them.</p>

<p>I have witnessed all the people during the very
earliest days of the war. I came to Liège, passing
between the forts, as described already. I was in
Lixhe when the pontoon bridge was wrecked
repeatedly by Fort Pontisse; I stayed at Visé three
times before the destruction began, and I was
there when the charming townlet was wrecked by
fire; and in Louvain I have been dragged from
my bed by six soldiers and arrested, when the whole
town was still ablaze.</p>

<p>Very well, I have:</p>

<ul><li>1. Never seen anything of a franc-tireur-guerilla.</li>

<li>2. Never seen anyone who was arrested as a
franc-tireur.</li>

<li>3. Never heard any German soldier, of whatever
rank, assert that he himself had witnessed any action
by a franc-tireur, although I questioned such
soldiers times without number. They always mentioned
others, who had left days ago, and were said
to have gone through the miserable experience!</li>

<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>

4. Never heard the <i>name</i> of any franc-tireur in
answer to my questions.</li></ul>

<p>But they were <i>always</i> German officers and no
others who talked about francs-tireurs, and at Visé,
Liège, Dinant, Bilsen, and particularly at Louvain,
they constantly pressed me and tried to make me
promise that I should write to <i>De Tijd</i> about francs-tireurs
and justify the devastations. These stories
emanated from the officers and permeated the rank
and file; and the men grew fearfully angry with
the Belgians, whom they cursed and abused.
It also made the soldiers terribly afraid of francs-tireurs,
and I noticed many a time that some
loud sound from a falling wall, for example,
made a whole troop of soldiers jump up, lay
hold of their rifles, and hide themselves in an
absolute "blue funk." The mere noise made
them curse and rage and talk of nothing but
burning houses.</p>

<p>In the end these stories of the soldiers convinced
even the inhabitants that there had been francs-tireurs,
but never in the place where they lived,
always somewhere else. They could not believe
that the Germans could be so cruel and wreck so
much property if nothing at all had happened;
and when at length the time came that they themselves
were obliged to fly, many of them believed
that their compatriots who <i>elsewhere</i> acted as francs-tireurs
were to blame for all the dire calamities.
But if they had had my opportunity to go "elsewhere"
and gather information there, they would
have been convinced of the untruth, and probably
would have heard the name of their own village as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
the scene of the occurrence. That was how rumours
and reports got about.</p>

<p>Many soldiers, probably most of them, were
undoubtedly of good faith, and <i>believed</i> what they
related; but the damnable notion had been put
into their heads by their superiors. That is why
I do not consider it impossible that <i>some</i> places were
wrecked on account of <i>alleged</i> acts by francs-tireurs.</p>

<p>I have explained already in the chapter "Round
about Liège" that I myself was duped occasionally,
for example, by the story of the three hundred
civilians who had been shot. To my mind these
violent acts at the beginning of the war were part
and parcel of the system of frightfulness, by which
the Germans tried to scare the population and
indirectly the hostile armies, at the same time
rousing their own soldiers to anger and fury.</p>

<p>That mad fury was also intensified considerably
by the accusations about gruesome mutilations
committed on German soldiers by Belgians, who
were said to have cut off the noses, ears, genitals,
and so on of their enemies. These rumours were
so persistent that in the end it was generally believed
in neutral countries that these things had happened
frequently.</p>

<p>No little astonishment was therefore created by
an interview which I published with Dr. van der
Goot of The Hague, who did so much excellent
work in the Red Cross Hospital at Maastricht. He
also had come to believe all these stories, and as
everybody always mentioned a large hospital in
Aix-la-Chapelle, which was said to be full of similarly
mutilated soldiers, Dr. van der Goot went to that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
town to see for himself. The chief medical officer
of that hospital in a conversation stated that not
one single case of that sort had been treated in his
institution nor in any of the other local hospitals
where he was a visiting physician. At a meeting
of the medical circle just lately held he had not
heard one word, nor had any one colleague, about
the treatment of similar cases.</p>

<p>In Louvain I was myself arrested, because a more
than half-drunk soldier had accused me of spying
and arson! There too I had to listen to all sorts
of abuse because I was a franc-tireur. And in spite
of all this they tried to extract a promise from me
to write against the francs-tireurs!</p>

<p>The history of the destruction of Visé affords
also interesting support to my opinion, as previously
expressed, that the violent actions of the Germans
took place according to a fully thought-out design.</p>

<p>During the early days of the war the papers
published a report, of German origin, that Visé had
been destroyed because francs-tireurs had appeared.
I was therefore not a little amazed when, arriving
there on August 8th, I found the townlet entirely
undamaged, and even the German military admitted
that they had not heard a word about francs-tireurs.</p>

<p>But the inhabitants were treated even then in
a most vexatious manner, and on August 14th (the
destruction came about on the 16th) I wrote to <i>De
Tijd</i> (No. 20457):&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Visé is under a real reign of terror. The day before
yesterday the town-crier walked the streets with his bell, and
announced that within twenty-four hours everyone had to
deliver his bicycle at the bridge. Anyone in whose house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
a bicycle should be found would be shot and his house set on
fire. Yesterday morning the Germans announced once more
that all arms, including those that were old or damaged or
taken to pieces, should be handed in at the town-hall within
an hour. If any arms should be found anywhere after that,
they would shoot the inhabitants and burn down the town.
Eatables and drinkables were requisitioned continuously under
threats of firing the town, and the inhabitants are afraid of
nothing so much as of the possibility that something may be
required some day or other that cannot be produced."</p></blockquote>

<p>Even before that, on August 11th I sent a communication,
by post or cable (<i>De Tijd</i>, No. 20353),
in which the following is found:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In and round about Visé people sleep in their cellars, as
they are threatened frequently that the town will be set on
fire."</p></blockquote>

<p>Anyone who, like myself, has been able to see
in what frame of mind the people were during the
first days of the German occupation, cannot believe
it possible that they would even think of taking up
arms. They lived in an unending terror, tried to
forestall the invader's demands, and, if anything was
requisitioned, they searched each other's houses
to see whether anything was kept back and all the
demanded bottles of gin or claret were forthcoming.
There was not one who did not keep his door open
as widely as possible to prove his complete submissiveness,
and to let the Germans enter his house
at any time to check what was to be found there.
Every moment I saw men or women run into the
street offering cigars to the soldiers from open boxes,
smiling nervously and desperately, trying to behave
as unconcernedly as possible. During those early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
days payment for refreshments was accepted hardly
anywhere, and people often refused to accept money
from me, because they mistook me for a German.</p>

<p>Men and young women in the prime of life sat
whole days in a chair, or lay abed, because in the
most literal sense of the word they were unable to
stand on their feet for fear and terror, caused by
the incessant menaces.</p>

<p>And during these first days of the war I had not
met a single person who was able to settle down
quietly in the existing circumstances, not a single
person in whom anger and fury subdued fear and
terror.</p>

<p>Is it thinkable that persons in that frame of mind
would take up arms and invite the enemy's revenge
upon themselves and those near and dear to them,
a revenge of which they were so mortally afraid?</p>

<p>And supposing for a moment that the allegations
made by the Germans were true, that there had
been shooting at Visé for example, then one might
perhaps consider the revenge justifiable, but should
also expect that they would punish with a heavy
heart, conscious that they were inflicting a necessary
evil.</p>

<p>Of a heavy heart, however, there was not a trace.
In the previous chapter I described how beastly they
behaved during the destruction of Visé; how the
soldiers drank immoderate quantities of alcohol,
and then jeered at the wretched refugees; how
they indulged in unmitigated vandalism, and
wrecked by hand things of which they knew that
by and by would be destroyed by fire.</p>

<p>Children and old people perished in consequence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
of the cruel heartlessness of the Germans, and in
St. Hadelin College they robbed their own wounded
of medical help and surgical appliances.</p>

<p>This happened not only at Visé, but also at other
places which I visited, more especially at Louvain.
And those who read the following chapters carefully
will find sufficient support for my opinion, that
<i>Belgium is innocent of the base charges and allegations
uttered by Germany, which country soiled its conscience
still worse, first by plunging the little kingdom into
the direst misery, and then by accusing it falsely of
crimes which it never committed</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />

WITH THE FLEMINGS</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Between</span> my tours through the Liège district I
made a trip in the direction of Tongres, because I
wanted to know what had become of all those
Germans who had crossed the Meuse near Lixhe.
It was remarkable to notice how friendly the
Flemings of that district behaved with regard to
the Germans. Although they criticised the violation
of the country's neutrality sharply, and every
family was proud of the sons who had taken up
arms in defence of their Fatherland, yet they judged
quite kindly the German soldiers who passed through
their district. I often heard expressions full of
pity toward those men, who could not help themselves,
but were compelled to do whatever their
superiors commanded them.</p>

<p>The Germans did themselves great injury undoubtedly
by their vulgar and barbarous demeanour,
for that lost them every claim on the sympathy of
the people.</p>

<p>They behaved tolerably well during the first few
days after the occupation of Tongres; but that
did not last long, and soon they began here also to
commit atrocious acts of terrorism. One evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
at about the middle of August several civilians
were killed, a dozen houses along the road to Maastricht
were fired, and in the town the windows of
several shops smashed, which was followed by general
looting. That lost them whatever sympathy they
might have met with in the district.</p>

<p>On August 12th I came for the first time to
Tongres. They had been there only a few days,
and only near the town-hall did I see a goodly
number of the garrison. Many wounded were
brought there, and carried in through the door under
the outside stairway. They came from Haelen,
where a battle was being fought that afternoon
and for which they had left in the morning. For
the attack on the entrenched Belgians they had
used cavalry exclusively, who were simply mowed
down by the murderous fire from the hidden
mitrailleuses and the infantry fire from the trenches.
The Germans suffered a great reverse, and were
deeply embittered.</p>

<p>Just outside Tongres I met a fleet of Red Cross
cars loaded with wounded. Cavalry escorted them.
I was stopped and ordered to go back, as they
expected the Belgians to attack Tongres.</p>

<p>I thought the result of the battle of Haelen
rather important, and should have liked to have
wired it immediately to my paper. Until now I
had always gone on foot, that being the only conveyance
which the Germans could not seize. But
this time I preferred a bicycle, as the only way to
get to The Netherlands on that same day. So I tried
at a couple of bicycle-shops to get a second-hand
one for love and money. At the first shop I asked:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose, madame, that you have an old
'bike' to sell?"</p>

<p>She looked me up and down suspiciously, and
then said:</p>

<p>"No, I've none to sell."</p>

<p>I did not fare better at the next. There the
answer was:</p>

<p>"I refuse to sell 'bikes' to Germans."</p>

<p>"But, madame, I am not German; I am a
Netherlander. I should...."</p>

<p>"I can hear quite well that you are German, and
if you were a Netherlander you would not venture
on a bike at this moment. If you come here to
seize my bikes, I'll deliver them, for I cannot do
anything against that, but I refuse to sell them of
my own free-will."</p>

<p>The dear lady rapped it out in such a decided tone
of voice that I desisted. I told my trouble to the
proprietor of a café where I took a glass of beer; he,
examining my papers, placed confidence in me, and
got me a rickety thing, for which I paid twenty-two
francs.</p>

<p>After all, this was better than walking, so I decided
to make a small detour, go once more to Liège, and
see how the forts were. I lost my way in a maze
of by-roads, and got at last back to the main road
near Jupille, where I met a patrol of Uhlans, who
came in my direction at a trot.</p>

<p>Already from a distance with much fuss they
signalled to me to stop, and of course I obeyed at
once. Two men dismounted, came to me in a
perfect rage, and, without asking who I was or
what I was doing, cut my tyres to pieces in several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
places; they abused me with wild gesticulations
and threats, jumped on their horses, and rode off.
I dragged my wretched vehicle with its stabbed
tyres a little distance, but then met a second patrol,
who showed still greater indignation, and destroyed
it altogether.</p>

<p>For the rest of the journey I used my only remaining
means of transport, my legs, and after a walk of
some hours got to the frontier of The Netherlands
near Oud-Vroenhoven. A Netherland custom-house
officer asked for my papers, and I showed him
my huge passport. The man looked at the sheet
critically, and made out that I could not possibly
be a Netherlander, as I was the holder of a "foreign"
passport.</p>

<p>My "foreign" passport was, of course, in French,
of which language the man evidently knew not a
word. Although I explained that this passport
was the best one could get in The Netherlands,
that I had paid six guilders and seventy-five cents
for it, that I was a war-correspondent of <i>De Tijd</i>,
it was all useless. I had to go with him to the
guard-house, and the man kept the queer passport&mdash;the
damning piece of evidence&mdash;firmly in his
hand. All the inquisitive loafers, of which the
frontier was full during those days, followed me,
and so we went in procession to the guard-house,
at some distance from the frontier. I heard all
sorts of discussions behind me, and constantly
caught words like: German, boche, deserter, franc-tireur,
spy, and other complimentary niceties.</p>

<p>As soon as I had entered the guard-house a
soldier, rifle in hand, mounted guard. The cus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>tom-house
officer handed my French passport to a
lieutenant, who scrutinised it closely. Then followed
the examination:</p>

<p>"You are a journalist?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"On which paper?"</p>

<p>"<i>De Tijd</i>, sir; here is my press-card."</p>

<p>"Where is <i>De Tijd</i> printed?"</p>

<p>"In Amsterdam...."</p>

<p>"In which street?"</p>

<p>"Well ...! The Nieuwe Zijds Voorburgwal."</p>

<p>"All right; you may go!"</p>

<p>Having pushed my way through the loafers, who
stood waiting before the house, I was able to continue
my journey to Maastricht.</p>

<p>A few days later I had to go to Canne, a Belgian
hamlet near the frontier, south of Maastricht. In
the evening of August 18th an atrociously barbarous
crime had been committed there, a cool-blooded
murder. At Canne live some good, kind
Flemings, who would not hurt a fly. The kind-hearted
burgomaster had, moreover, tried for days
to comfort his fellow-citizens, and was for ever
saying:</p>

<p>"Leave everything to me; I'll invite them to have
a glass of wine with me, and you will see then that
they are kind people."</p>

<p>This he had done. Already for many days he had
treated several officers to his best claret.</p>

<p>Tuesday night, August 18th, at about 11 o'clock,
a train of luggage carts passed through Canne, and
in the village the Browning of one of the soldiers
in the last van went off suddenly. This was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
signal for all Germans to start shooting indiscriminately,
anywhere, at anything, happily without
hitting anybody. A few tipsy soldiers went to the
burgomaster's house, and no sooner had his wife
opened the door for the barbarians, when a shot was
fired, the bullet passing through the unfortunate
lady's head into the wall opposite the door.
I was there early the next morning and saw the hole.
It is evident that the soldiers ill-treated the dead
lady with their rifles in a horrible manner, for a large
part of the wall was spattered over with blood.</p>

<p>After having murdered the burgomaster's wife, the
villains attacked a guest, Mr. Derricks, a lawyer, and
member of the Provincial States, whom they killed
with a bayonet. His wife broke a leg when she
tried to fly to the cellar.</p>

<p>Mr. Derricks lived at Roelanche, but with his
wife and seven children had fled for security to
Canne, where he was hospitably received in Mr.
Poswick's, the burgomaster's, house.</p>

<p>When I got to the house everything was in a
frightful state. A pair of curtains showed traces
of fire; cupboards had been emptied, and nearly all
the china and glass broken; statuary lay broken on
the floor; windows were smashed; bits of bricks
and plaster from the ceilings, through which many
shots had been fired, completed the scene of destruction.
On the doorstep I picked up a cartridge-case,
which I have always kept, because it is highly
probable that it had contained the bullet which
killed Mrs. Poswick.</p>

<p>This terrible tragedy took place at scarcely six
yards from the Netherland frontier, for the burgo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>master's
house stands by a road half Belgian and half
Netherland. The Netherland soldiers who were
doing frontier-duty on the latter part had to fly
from the mad shooting of the Germans. They hid
behind a wall that was quickly full of bullet-holes.
The German soldiers spent a considerable time
guzzling the burgomaster's wine, which they looted,
and afterwards went off in the direction of Tongres.</p>

<p>It was stated later on that the German authorities
punished the culprits and had them executed
at Aix-la-Chapelle; <i>De Tijd</i> of August 31st, 1914,
also reported it. But the action of these soldiers was
not worse than that of generals who had entire cities
destroyed and civilians killed by the hundred, but
were always screened by the German Government.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On Thursday, August 20th, I decided to go once
more in the direction of Tongres. As the Germans
had picketed the main road along the Netherland
frontier, I made a detour and dragged my bicycle
across the mountain near Petit Laney, a very trying
job in the stifling heat. From the mountain top
I had a beautiful vista, which enabled me to see that
near Riemst a large German force was encamped
at which I desired to have a look. So I walked
down the hill to Canne, where some crofters were
trying to get their cattle into The Netherlands.
These poor creatures, who usually own two or three
head of cattle, had been compelled already to give up
half of their stock. From Canne I cut through
corn and beetroot fields to the road to Riemst.
The first German sentinels were tolerably friendly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, so you are a Netherlander, aren't you?
Then we are friends. The Netherlands remains
neutral, does she not? What news have you from
there; are you already at war with Britain?"</p>

<p>These and similar questions were asked after a
superficial examination of my papers, and, having
answered them, I was allowed to go on. But at a
certain moment an officer appeared, who summoned
me to dismount, and asked for my papers. After
a short examination he ordered a soldier to take
me to the commanding officer at Riemst.</p>

<p>The attitude of all the soldiers changed immediately;
they looked at me with angry eyes, and from
time to time I heard hostile remarks. Whenever I
did not walk quickly enough or turned a little to the
right or the left, my escort pulled me roughly by the
arm. All the same I took the case as coolly as
possible, fully convinced that the commanding
officer would release me after a superficial examination.</p>

<p>At Riemst, the soldier took, or rather pummelled
me into a large farm-house, and soon I faced the bigwigs,
who had made themselves as comfortable as
possible in a large room. Several pictures and engravings
lay on the ground in pieces, whilst numerous
full and empty wine-bottles indicated that they had
abundantly worshipped at the shrine of Bacchus,
and intended to go on with the cult. The higher
officers and the subalterns seemed to be frantically
busy; at least they had violent discussions with many
gesticulations over a map. The soldier reported
that he had brought me here by order of Lieutenant
Such&mdash;I did not catch the name&mdash;and then it began:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span></p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"I am...."</p>

<p>"What do you want here&mdash;what are you here
for?"</p>

<p>"I am a Netherland jour...."</p>

<p>"What! A Netherlander? I suppose you come
to see how many troops are here, don't you? And
then...."</p>

<p>"Please be good enough to have a look at my
papers, and then...."</p>

<p>"Papers? Papers? Yes, of course you all have
papers; all those villains who shot at our men at
Visé come back from The Netherlands with papers,
in order to start afresh. Later on I'll have a look
at that stuff. Here, lock him up for the present."</p>

<p>He pointed to a couple of soldiers, and they laid
hold of me. They took me to a small room, where
I was astonished to find two soldiers with revolvers
guarding a priest and a peasant. As soon as the
door was closed behind me I wished to chat with
my fellow-prisoners, for even in prison I was not
oblivious of my journalistic duties. But they
seemed not at all anxious to have anything to do
with me, and I soon understood the reason why.
At each question they threw timid glances at the
two watch-dogs, and I saw that fear of these made
them withhold all information. However, after a
good deal of trouble I got to know that the priest
was the parish priest, and his companion in misery
the burgomaster. They had been taken as hostages,
and would suffer punishment for acts the villagers
might eventually commit against the German
usurpers. I contented myself with this, as I felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
that in the circumstances further questions might
make things awkward for these two men.</p>

<p>What might happen next? Sitting on a chair
in a corner of the room I began to consider my
position. For the moment it was not agreeable,
but by and by those officers might find time to look
at my papers. The only thing I bothered about
was a map marked with the places where, according
to the latest news, the German and French armies
were. I kept it in an inside coat-pocket, and it
might be found if they should search me.</p>

<p>I spent three hours in the small room with my
silent companions. At last I was called, and
appeared once more before the casual court-martial.</p>

<p>"Very well, now give me those papers."</p>

<p>Having got them, several officers examined my
credentials, and their faces showed that the horizon
was a little clearer for me.</p>

<p>"Oh, you are a journalist? And what came
you here for?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I wanted to follow, as far as the
German Authorities desire to allow it, the movements
of the German armies, in order to give
reliable information to the Netherland public, who
take a great interest in your progress."</p>

<p>"Indeed! And did you take notes already?
Just let me have a look."</p>

<p>The turn things took now was not quite to my
liking, and I did not feel very safe when I handed
him my scribbling-pad.</p>

<p>"I cannot read a word of it! Can you read it at
all yourself? Yes? Oh, but I cannot understand
it. Translate some of it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span></p>

<p>That was a relief! I began to translate, taking
the liberties to which every translator is entitled.
And I succeeded in making a favourable impression
by censoring my own manuscript.</p>

<p>"Well, that is right enough. But, mind, don't
say in your paper that you found troops here, and
especially avoid telling which troops."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir."</p>

<p>"Nor must you tell them that we detained you
here. That was really not our intention at all, but
just now we had no time to examine your papers."</p>

<p>"All right, sir."</p>

<p>"And what is the news in The Netherlands about
the war?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, not much beyond what you are sure
to know already: that Japan declared war against
Germany; that the Russians invaded Germany;
that the French gained some important victories
in Alsace; that the German fleet lost some
ships...."</p>

<p>"Oh, bosh! Stop it! These are, of course,
all lies from Reuter; they did not come from Wolff.
Japan is not going to declare war against us; much
rather against Russia!"</p>

<p>"Oh, but, sir, Wolff confirmed these reports."</p>

<p>"Oh no! That is impossible, and, after all, we
are not afraid of Japan either. You had better
write in your paper that we are not afraid of anything
excepting Montenegro. And you may also
inform your readers that it is better for Netherlanders
not to cross the frontier, as we are going
to apply much stricter measures. For we have
evidence that those people from Visé and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
villages who fled to The Netherlands are returning
with forged papers, in order to shoot at us. And
now you may go, but back to Maastricht at once."</p>

<p>"But will you then please give me a pass, otherwise
I may be detained again on my way back."</p>

<p>"Oh yes! You may have that!"</p>

<p>And the commanding officer gave me a pass,
on which this very same colonel who had prohibited
me to write in my paper what troops were at
Riemst, put a stamp on that pass, which contained
the German eagle, and besides this the words:
"Royal Prussian 8, Reserve Infantry Regiment,
II Battalion." This confirmed what the rumours
said, that the troops who had passed through Visé
and other places during the last days and committed
those atrocities there, were the reserves which had
been called up, among whom discipline is less strict
than among the younger men, who arrived in these
districts during the earlier days.</p>

<p>Although I had been commanded to return "at
once" to Maastricht, I succeeded in having a chat
here and there with the inhabitants of Riemst. I
had visited the village about eight days ago, but
what a change! Then the people assured me that
"die Duutschen"<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> were not so bad after all, that
they were compelled to do their duty, and were
kind to the inhabitants if these were kind to them.</p>

<p>And at present? Every word expressed hate,
profound hate, hardly controlled. They trembled
all over when they spoke in deep, inspiring voices
about "die Duutschen."<a name="FNanchor_2b_2b" id="FNanchor_2b_2b"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Everything of value had been stolen from them:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>horses, cows, sheep, carts, bicycles, everything,
everything!&mdash;only in some cases payment was made
with tickets, which might be cashed after the war.
During the night the German soldiers slept in the
rooms, but the inhabitants&mdash;men, women, children,
babies and sick persons&mdash;they locked in barns and
cellars, which they boarded up.</p>

<p>I was not allowed to return by bicycle, and left
it at a café at the crossing of the roads to Tongres
and Riemst. A couple of days later the Germans
had already abstracted the tyres.</p>

<p>The road to The Netherlands was strewn over
with empty wine-bottles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

LIÈGE AFTER THE OCCUPATION</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Next</span> day I was already back in Liège, where much
was changed after my last visit. The Germans
went on terrorising the inhabitants, and these, being
extremely frightened, looked with suspicion at
every stranger. In the streets was the smoke of
burning houses, especially from Outre-Meuse.</p>

<p>In every quarter I met Belgian refugees from the
south, and Netherlanders who wanted to escape
to their safe native country. The Liège people
themselves were not allowed to leave.</p>

<p>Nearly every hour another proclamation was
posted; and this made the people still more nervous.
One of them brought the information that the
province of Liège had to pay a war-tax of fifty
million francs. Another forbade the people to be
out in the streets after six o'clock p.m.; the doors
must remain open, the windows show the lights.
Burning and shooting were threatened if any more
arms should be found, and all houses were to be
searched.</p>

<p>Many shops were closed on account of lack of
stock, as everything had been requisitioned, and
as yet no traffic was allowed to bring in fresh pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>visions.
All this bother made the inhabitants
discontented, but frightened them at the same
time; they grumbled and whispered, and looked
about with malicious, flaming eyes, but in mortal
fear.</p>

<p>Labourers were called up to assist in reinforcing
the conquered forts on the left bank of the Meuse,
the forts which by and by might be used to shell
their fellow-countrymen, in case the Germans
should be forced to retire. Nobody will have
offered himself for this work voluntarily, the less
so as the proclamation wound up as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Des ouvriers volontaires seront embauchés à partir du
21 Août sur la rive gauche de la Meuse, où on fera connaître
les conditions détaillées":</p>

<p>("Voluntary workmen will be enrolled from August 21st
on the left bank of the Meuse, where details of the conditions
will be made known.")</p></blockquote>

<p>The streets and squares where the high military
officers had established themselves were closed by
cordons of soldiers, and nobody was allowed to pass
them.</p>

<p>The town was entirely shut off from war- and
other news.</p>

<p>I informed a few priests of the Pope's death, which
had been known in The Netherlands for several
days. They knew nothing about it, and asked
whether I had any proof by me. I gave them <i>De
Tijd</i> printed with a black border, and armed with
this document they went to communicate the sad
news to the Right Reverend Rutten, bishop of Liège.</p>

<p>I also brought consternation to the nunnery at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
which my cousin lives by this same report of the
Holy Father's demise; and the good dear Sisters
roamed through the passages, wringing their hands
and repeating: "Le Pape est mort!&mdash;le Pape est
mort!" ("The Pope is dead!")</p>

<p>I met a doctor at this nunnery, who told me
highly important news, but in whispers, because
in these days "even walls have ears": the Allies
had gained great victories over the Germans. As
he saw by the expression of my face that I did not
believe off-hand all he told, he became still more
impressive in manner, and produced a paper, from
which he recited:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Great German defeat at Libramont&mdash;nine thousand
prisoners taken."</p>

<p>"In Alsace the French are near the Rhine."</p>

<p>"The Russians advanced fifty miles into East Prussia."</p></blockquote>

<p>In the same way the list went on for a goodly
length, and he became actually angry when even
then I refused to believe everything. He was
especially pleased with the account of the victory
near Libramont. He had a friend, also a physician,
who had been compelled by the Germans to go with
them in the medical service, and this friend had told
him this himself. It was remarkable that educated,
superior persons could become so narrow-minded
in times like these, and believed anything simply
because they hoped that it might be true.</p>

<p>The town was full of soldiers, and I had great
trouble to find lodgings. "Tout est pris par les
Allemands" ("Everything is taken by the Germans")
was the answer I got everywhere, with the result<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
that I was still hunting for a bedroom after six
o'clock, although nobody was then allowed in the
streets. I was stopped at every turn, and after
explaining my case got a hint to hurry up.</p>

<p>At last I found an hotel, where I could have a
small garret, against which arrangement I had not
the slightest objection in the circumstances. The
café downstairs looked rather peculiar, with a great
number of looking-glasses, and ladies with powdered
faces. These seemed not averse to closer relations
with me, but when I pretended not to understand
a single word of French, they soon gave it up,
and showed no further desire for my friendship.
But I could see quite well that they discussed
the question whether I was a German officer or
a spy?</p>

<p>I went to bed early, for that day I had again
walked from Maastricht to Liège. My little bedroom
was quite in the roof of the house, and had
evidently been used by a servant.</p>

<p>About midnight I was roused by an infernal
noise in the street. People yelled and screamed
most fearfully, and I heard rifle-shots also.</p>

<p>I felt not the slightest inclination to go and see
what was the matter, but I stretched myself and
yawned, feeling much more tired after a couple of
hours' rest than when I went to bed. The uproar
went on, and suddenly I thought that I also heard
a hubbub in the café downstairs. And, really,
it came ever nearer. People rushed up and down the
stairs, screamed and yelled, doors were banged, in
short it was as if they were pulling down the house.</p>

<p>Very sleepy, I went on listening ... listening ...<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
probably until I fell asleep again, for I cannot remember
what happened after.</p>

<p>I woke up in the morning, and when going downstairs
saw that the doors of all the rooms stood open,
and everything inside was in great disorder. In
the café tables and chairs were overturned, and
broken looking-glasses lay on the floor. The front
door was also open, and I walked away.</p>

<p>And now the explanation? During the night the
Germans had started house-to-house searches, and
wherever the doors were not opened quickly enough,
the soldiers began to shoot. The inhabitants were
then driven into the street amid loud screams
and cries. It was also said that some persons had
been shot.</p>

<p>By what accident had I not been disturbed? The
height, perhaps, at which my miserable little garret-room
was situated.</p>

<p>The hotel where I stayed that night was called
<i>Hôtel de la Paix</i>; an hotel of peace, indeed!</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

LOUVAIN DESTROYED</h2>

<p>As soon as I heard about the horrors that took
place at Louvain, I hastened to try and get there to
find out, if possible, by personal observation the
truth of the numberless conflicting stories that would
undoubtedly grow up from the facts. I expected
that the situation round about the town would be
rather critical, and decided to proceed cautiously.
It is rather a long stretch of nearly forty-five miles,
but I succeeded in getting to Louvain in the afternoon.</p>

<p>The road itself had prepared me already in some
degree for the horrors I should find there. All the
villages through which I passed, excepting Tongres
and the townlets of St. Trond, Borgloon, and
Tirlemont, were for the greater part burned down or
shelled into ruins. The German troops, who had
been stoutly resisted during their march through
St. Trond and Tirlemont, had attacked in a great
rage the civilian population. They set the houses on
fire and aimed their rifles at the terror-stricken
civilians who fled from them. The men were nearly
all killed, but women and children were shot as
well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span></p>

<p>On the road from Borgloon to Thienen I had a
chat with an old crone, who stood weeping by the
ruins of her miserable little cottage, which she refused
to leave. This little house, which strenuous
zeal had enabled her to buy, was all she possessed on
earth besides her two sons, both fallen through the
murderous lead of those barbarians, and buried in the
little garden at the back of their ruined home. Of
another family, living close by, the father and two
sons were murdered in the same way.</p>

<p>Between Thienen and Louvain I met endless
trains of refugees, exactly like those I had seen
already near Visé, Liège, and other places. These
also carried their wretched bundles, and children
and young people did their utmost to encourage
and support their elders on their arduous path. All
these people saluted me in a cringing, timid manner,
nodding smilingly and taking off their caps already
from afar.</p>

<p>I saw some extremely poor people, very old and
stiff, to whom walking was nearly impossible. A
Bavarian soldier escorted them. He had his rifle
slung across his back and in both hands carried the
luggage of the unfortunate creatures. He seemed
to have come a long way already, for he looked
tired, and the perspiration ran down his face.
Although it is only natural to assist one's fellow-creatures,
this scene touched me, for hitherto I
had seen the Germans commit rough, inhuman
deeds only.</p>

<p>I noticed the smell of fire already several miles
from Louvain. On both sides of the road small
mounds indicated the graves of soldiers who fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
during the brave resistance of the Belgians before
Louvain. A small wooden cross and some pieces
of accoutrement were the only decorations. Carcases
of horses were lying in the fields, from which
came a disagreeable smell.</p>

<p>The town was on fire, and ruddy smoke hovered
over it. Deserted like a wilderness, not a soul
moved in the streets. The first street I entered was
the Rue de la Station. Large, imposing mansions
used to stand here, but the devouring fire consumed
even the last traces of former greatness.</p>

<p>All houses were on fire, and every now and then
walls fell down with a roar of thunder, shrouding
the greater part of the street in a thick cloud of
suffocating smoke and dust. Sometimes I had to
run to escape from the filthy mass. On several walls
an order was written in chalk directing the men to
come to the market-place to assist in extinguishing
the fire, and the women to stay indoors. As soon
as the order had been obeyed the Germans drove
the men from the market to the station, where they
were packed in trucks like cattle.</p>

<p>Farther on in the Rue de la Station lay nine rotting
carcases of horses, the intestines oozing from the
bodies, and a greasy substance was poured over their
skin. The stench was unbearable and made breathing
nearly impossible, which compelled me to jump
on my bicycle and escape as quickly as possible from
the pestilential surroundings.</p>

<p>The sun was already setting, and became still
redder, making still more abominable and more
infernal the glare of the burning town. Nobody
moved about in this abode of death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span></p>

<p>I roamed about aimlessly in a scorching heat.
Whither? I did not know myself. I did not know
Louvain and met nobody whom I might ask something.
I came near a couple of streets that were only
ruins; the walls collapsed against each other and
filled the roadway with rubbish, so that sometimes
I could not see whether I walked on or beside the
place where the houses used to stand.</p>

<p>Bicycling was of course out of the question;
I shouldered my bicycle and stepped across the glowing
cinders, which singed my soles. One spot could
still be recognised as a street corner. Three soldiers
emerged there suddenly and aimed at me with their
rifles.</p>

<p>I explained who I was, and was then allowed to
come nearer. They were drunk, and with glassy
eyes talked about francs-tireurs, the friendship
Germans felt for Netherlanders, and so on. One
of them entered the still burning corner house and
returned with three bottles of wine, one a bottle of
Champagne; corks were drawn and one of the
bottles handed to me. First I said that I never took
wine, then that the doctor had forbidden it; it was
of no use. The fellow who held the bottle in front
of me got nasty, and shouted:</p>

<p>"If you don't drink with us you are not our
friend." At the same time he beat the ground with
his rifle-butt and, willy-nilly, I had to drink.</p>

<p>Suddenly several shots sounded in the neighbourhood.
The three took their rifles and looked round,
somewhat scared. They assured me that they would
protect me. If there had been occasion for it, it
would have been against their own comrades,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
for a troop of soldiers came sailing along, swinging
about their rifles and shooting at the burning houses
as they walked on, without rhyme or reason, anyhow
and anywhere. These were drunk also. At last I
was able to shake off my "friends," and got through
another street into the market-place, at the town-hall
and St. Peter's Church. The beautiful town-hall
happily was not destroyed, as the first reports
intimated, but St. Peter's had been damaged most
cruelly. The spire had disappeared, the roof
collapsed, windows broken, the altar burned, the
pulpit badly damaged, and so forth. The two last-named
parts were fine works of art.</p>

<p>For the rest most houses in the market-place
were on fire. Soldiers were billeted on one of the
corner houses, and I was of course detained there,
but released again, after having been requested to
show up the francs-tireurs. I had to consider also
where I might pass the night in this burning city?
I asked an officer's consent to stay the night with
the soldiers. He gave his permission if I could get
the consent of the commanding officer, whom I
might find at the station; he told me that he was
sure to grant it.</p>

<p>Before I got there I passed the Halls of Louvain,
the building that contained the world-famous
library, with its numerous art-treasures. Only the
outer walls were left standing, inside it was all ruins.
All was reduced to dust, to miserable rubbish, and
never will one single page be recovered of all those
thousands of burned manuscripts.</p>

<p>I was greatly astonished to see a little old man
sitting by his house, while all those in the neighbour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>hood
were burning. His own dwelling had escaped
without much damage, and was only hit by rifle
bullets. He told me that his family had fled, his
son with wife and all children but one, a small boy.
At length he left also, but had lost his way outside
the town, and returned to his house, where the
Germans "allowed" him to remain. I considered
that I might after all sleep better in that house
than yonder among the soldiers, and asked the
little man whether he would put me up for the
night. He did not object at all; but in spite of
my pressing, he refused absolutely to accept any
payment.</p>

<p>"But," he said, "but perhaps you brought some
bread with you to eat on the road, and I should like
to have a piece of that ... not for myself ...
but for my grandchild; we had nothing to eat
all day long, and the little boy is so ... is so
hungry."</p>

<p>The poor man wept, and, although I had taken
with me no more than two pieces of bread-and-butter,
which I had not touched yet, I could not
bear the sight of these poor, hungry things, and
handed over to them my food.</p>

<p>As I passed a Red Cross Hospital, partly spared,
I noticed a Flemish doctor, who first looked at me
from the door held ajar, and then came nearer;
a strapping young fellow with a black beard. After
I had made myself known as a Netherlander, he
was clearly surprised, and it seemed as though he
had a lot to ask or to tell. I expected to hear a
torrent of abuse against the Huns, who had destroyed
everything, and murdered so many innocent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
people, or a lament about the valuable treasures
of the library, which also had not been spared;
but no, other thoughts occupied his mind. With
a slightly trembling voice he asked:</p>

<p>"Ah well, you come from The Netherlands;
tell me whether it is true that you have let the
Germans through, allowing them to ravish us?
Tell me whether this is true?"</p>

<p>The man became quite excited, and took hold of
my sleeve. He looked me straight in the face, as
if he wanted to find out by the expression of my
eyes whether I spoke the truth. I could easily
stand the scrutinising look, for I knew too well how
utterly false those suspicions were. So I replied
with great emphasis:</p>

<p>"I know that those rumours have been spread
about, but also that they were contradicted by
Belgian officials. I know also, and can affirm it
from my own personal observation, that there is
not a single word of truth in those accusations, for
I passed the early days of the war in the district
where the fight was going on."</p>

<p>The good man's face became quite cheerful, he
grasped my hand, deeply moved, and, pressing it
warmly, said:</p>

<p>"Ah, well, I am sincerely glad to hear that. You
cannot believe what awful sorrow it gave us,
Flemings, when we heard that the Netherlanders
were conspiring with the Germans."</p>

<p>The doctor now became more communicative
on other matters. According to him the Germans
contended that the inhabitants had been shooting
from windows and cellars, in order to prevent the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
garrison from assisting their comrades, who were
fighting a battle against the Belgians at a distance
of about four miles and a half from the town.
Such an organised action of the inhabitants, under
the tyrannical rule of the Germans during the
eight days before the destruction, he called impossible,
and therefore the whole accusation absurd.
At any rate they had felt that the destruction was
coming, and had been planned systematically, for
during those eight days the Germans had plundered
the population, and taken from them all bread,
even what they required to feed themselves.</p>

<p>To avenge this alleged shooting by civilians the
fires had been kindled in the houses, maxims placed
in the streets, women and children beaten, men
imprisoned or murdered.</p>

<p>The discovery by the Germans of so-called depôts
of Belgian rifles, each rifle labelled with the name
of a citizen, was a gigantic "misunderstanding."
Already before the Germans occupied the town
the burgomaster had issued an order that all arms
should be delivered. The inhabitants had obeyed,
and the rifles were provided with a card so that
each might be returned to the lawful owner after
the war. This collection of arms has been used
by the Germans as evidence of an organised revolt
of the citizens.</p>

<p>When I told the doctor that I had to go to the
station, he explained to me how I could get there
without walking across red hot cinders, and I
followed his advice. I walked through quarters
which used to be the pride of the city, but were
now turned into heaps of rubbish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span></p>

<p>They made also sad havoc of the Boulevard de
Namur. Many mansions of the aristocracy had
been destroyed and many people killed. There
were corpses still lying on the Boulevard as I passed,
all in a state of decay. The smell was unbearable
and the sight loathsome, especially when I saw
several drunken soldiers insulting the bodies of these
unfortunate people.</p>

<p>In the flowerbeds in front of the station many
corpses had been buried, especially those of soldiers
who had been killed in the fight near Louvain.
The station itself was well guarded, but, thanks to
my passport and resolute manner, I gained admission
and was finally ushered into the presence of the
man who is responsible for the destruction of
Louvain, Von Manteuffel.</p>

<p>I had expected to meet a terrible creature, but
must admit that he was as kind as possible. As
soon as he had learned from my papers that I was
a Netherland journalist, he jumped up and stood
in the attitude as though he saw in me the personification
of the Kaiser. He already probably felt
the pangs of remorse, and now wanted to try and
justify himself as far as possible in the eyes of the
public.</p>

<p>He stated that the cause of the destruction was
the necessity of punishment, because Belgian soldiers
in civilian dress had stayed behind in Louvain,
waiting to attack the German army from behind at
the first favourable opportunity. They thought
that their chance had come when for a short time
the German troops had to be withdrawn from the
fortified camp of Antwerp to take their share in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
fight near Louvain. Von Manteuffel thought that
by attacking the troops in the town the Belgians
hoped to prevent the Louvain garrison from assisting
their comrades.</p>

<p>He did not seem to mind much the destruction
of the Halls with their world-famous wealth of
books; anyway he spoke about it in an unconcerned
tone. But he seemed to attach great importance
to the safety of the town-hall. He said that when
the buildings adjoining the town-hall began to
burn, he had them blown up in order to keep the
fire away from the beautiful monument.</p>

<p>As darkness was coming on I asked him whether
it was not dangerous to pass the night in the house
of that little old man, whom I mentioned above.
He saw nothing dangerous in it, as by far the greater
part of the town was deserted, and no attack need
be feared.</p>

<p>So I thought that I might chance it. The house
was some distance from the station, near the railway
line; opposite stood a sort of goods station guarded
by six soldiers. Before entering the house I had
a chat with them, for I thought that if I explained
my position and told them that the commanding
officer gave me permission to pass the night in that
house, I should be much safer if anything should
happen during the night, because they knew then
that they had to deal with a neutral journalist.
They might moreover warn me should the fire that
was raging all around reach that house. So I told
the whole story to these fellows, who were also more
than half drunk, showed them my passports, gave
them some cigars, and after a friendly chat went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
to the old man who was to put me up for the
night.</p>

<p>There was of course no gas lit, and there was no
paraffin lamp in the house. I was shown to my
room by the dim light of a candle. The old man
could hardly get up the stairs, as he was trembling
all over in consequence of the days passed in fear
and dread. The ceiling of my bedroom had been
pierced by bullets, and the fragments covered nearly
the whole of the bed, which had not been made
after it was last used. The unaccustomed work
of stripping and making the bed was soon finished,
and I was hardly ready when a soldier entered
at the door, which had to be left open by order,
and shouted from the bottom of the staircase that
I was not allowed to have a light, and must blow
out my candle.</p>

<p>I was soon fast asleep, tired out by my bicycle ride
of that day of about forty-five miles, and my
wanderings through Liège. But my rest was not to
be a long one. At about ten o'clock I was awakened
by a great noise on the stairs, and was surprised to
see six armed soldiers in my room. That is not
exactly a pleasant manner of waking up after so
short a sleep. They informed me in a gruff voice
that I had to get up, to dress and follow them. As
I obeyed the order, I asked what gave me this
unexpected honour; but they refused to enlighten
me on that point.</p>

<p>After I had dressed in their presence, they searched
all my pockets, and felt all over my body to find out
whether I had any arms concealed about me. Then
three soldiers went downstairs, I had to follow these,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
and the other three came in the rear. I did not
understand at all of what capital crime I was
suspected which made it necessary to have me
arrested by six soldiers armed to the teeth.</p>

<p>We waited in the street for two of the soldiers
who went to fetch the old man. After waiting a
good while the poor wretch appeared between them.
He wept profusely, and between his loud sobs
affirmed repeatedly that he was innocent, that he
did not know me, that I told him I was a Netherland
journalist, and so on, and so on: "Oh, gentlemen!&mdash;oh,
gentlemen!" he exclaimed, "I must not leave
my little boy ... my laddie; ... he is quite
alone.... Oh, let me go!" ...</p>

<p>I pitied him from the bottom of my heart, and
tried to console him by remarking that it was all a
misunderstanding, and that I would see to it that
he would soon be released.</p>

<p>"Come now quietly," I said; "so much the
sooner you will be back with your laddie."</p>

<p>But he did not take any notice of all my exhortations
and was entirely impervious to them in his
grief. So I went to the station side by side with
the weeping man, and surrounded by the six soldiers.
The crackle of the flames, the sound of collapsing
houses seemed more terrifying in the night than
in day-time, and now and again I got a shock when
suddenly, by the uncertain light of the flames, I
saw the corpse of a civilian lying in the dark shade
of the tall trees on the Boulevard.</p>

<p>Whenever our escort fancied that they saw something,
they stopped and called out to the supposed
approaching persons: "Who goes there?" Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>times
it was only some shrubs that they saw; at
other times patrolling German soldiers. "Parole?"
was asked: "Duisburg!" and after that answer
they came nearer. At the station I was taken to
an officer who sat at a table on the platform and
had lit up his nearest surroundings by means of a
paraffin-lamp. My little old man wept now so
badly that he was quite unmanageable, and the
officer made up his mind to get rid of him as quickly
as possible.</p>

<p>"Tell me, father," he began, "did you allow
this man by your side to stay the night at your
house?"</p>

<p>"Oh ... oh ... let me ... go to my laddie
... let me go ... oh ... oh...."</p>

<p>"Yes, all right, you may go, but we only want
you to tell us what you know of this man."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;oh ... I don't understand you ... let
me go ... my little boy ... we have nothing
to eat ... we are innocent ... I do not know
the gentleman ... oh ... oh!"</p>

<p>I took the liberty to explain to the officer that
the man did not understand him, and stated that
he did not know me.</p>

<p>"Then, why did you want to stay at the man's
house?&mdash;what brought you here?"</p>

<p>Thus my examination opened. I told him everything
from beginning to end, also that the commanding
officer had given me permission to stay
at that house, that I had shown my papers to the
soldiers at the goods station opposite the house,
and that I did not understand why I should be put
to all this inconvenience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span></p>

<p>He explained to me that one of those soldiers
accused me of ... spying and arson. He had
thought to recognise in me a person who had asked
him that afternoon whether he was ... a Belgian
or a German soldier, and whom he had also seen
escaping from a factory which was in full blaze a
moment later.</p>

<p>Highly indignant, I claimed of course that that
soldier should also be called; but I was told that
I had better assume a more modest tone. I then
asked to be taken to the commanding officer, whom
I had seen that afternoon; but he was away on
inspection or something, and would not return
before the next morning.</p>

<p>After this the officer examined my papers carefully
one by one, and had to admit that they were in
perfect order. Still, he had no authority to take
a decision before I had been seen by the commanding
officer.</p>

<p>The old man was allowed to go home, escorted
by the same soldiers. At the very moment that
he was about to leave, I happened to notice on the
platform a gigantic heap of loaves, brought in by
train for the soldiers.</p>

<p>"Do you know," I asked the officer, "that this
old man and his grandchild are starving? He
put me up because I gave him a couple of pieces of
bread-and-butter for the child." He looked at
me somewhat crossly, but inquired all the same
whether my information was correct, and then
gave the old man two loaves, which dried his tears
immediately, and for which he thanked the donor
in a quivering voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span></p>

<p>Two soldiers now took everything I had in my
pockets, even my watch and my purse. This
brought also to light a German map of Belgium,
with a stamp "For military use only." I was
told in a gruff voice that this was a highly suspicious
thing, and that they could not understand how
it got into my possession. I replied quite coolly
that I had bought the thing in Aix-la-Chapelle
for one mark, where it could be had in many shops,
and that the words "For the military only" merely
revealed the shrewd German commercial instinct,
which knows that people always like to possess
things which are not meant for them.</p>

<p>I believe that this made him angry; at least he
ordered me to take off my shoes also, and their
inside was carefully examined.</p>

<p>I was now escorted to a spot where on some straw
several soldiers were sleeping, who had to do sentry-go
at two o'clock that night. It was a part of the
platform which was not even roofed, and entirely
under the open sky. But they anyway had straw
to lie on, and sufficient cover, but I had to lie down
between them on the flags, without any blanket.
A separate sentry was commanded to watch me;
every two hours another was charged with the
task. I was allowed to try and sleep, with the
warning that I should be shot at the slightest
attempt to escape.</p>

<p>It was a chilly night, and a dense heavy fog made
it impossible to see anything.... My "bed-fellows"
raged and fumed at me, saying that I was
one of those villains who had treacherously shot at
them. I shivered from the cold, and felt, as it were,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
the dampness of the wet stone floor entering my
system.</p>

<p>While all the others were denouncing me, one
soldier was ready to believe that I was a peaceful
foreign journalist, and that all the misunderstanding
would disappear the next morning as soon as I should
be taken to the commanding officer. He took pity
on me, and got a thick soldier's coat for me as cover.
I still feel grateful to the man for it! But sleep
was out of the question on that wet floor, in the
dense fog. When the guard was changed and
soldiers came back, or others went, they could not
see in the dark where they went, and treated me to
a kick against my head or some other part of my
body.</p>

<p>It was a fantastic night. Trains arrived out of
the foggy darkness, their screeching whistle resounding
from the far distance, and when they steamed
into the station a storm of noise arose. All these
trains brought British prisoners of war, captured
by the Germans at St. Quentin, and hundreds of
German soldiers escorted the trains, which were
all covered over with green branches, and looked
like copse-wood sliding along the railroad. As soon
as they rumbled into the station the escorts sang
loudly their patriotic songs, and "Germany before
all other!" ("Deutschland über Alles!") vibrated
through the fog.</p>

<p>The soldiers lying round about me, and those in
other parts of the station, got up, shouting, "There
are the British," and ran towards the arriving trains.
They jeered at the beaten enemies in all sorts of
vulgar and filthy words, which made the German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
enthusiasm absolutely lacking in chivalry. Eight
trains with captured British arrived during that
night.</p>

<p>At seven o'clock in the morning I was taken to
the commanding officer, and was glad to see him
again. He jumped up immediately and came to
me with a charming smile, when I pointed to my
escort and explained that I was a prisoner.</p>

<p>He flushed red with anger, and asked the sergeant
what it all meant. The latter told the story and
I filled in some details.</p>

<p>He showed the most profound indignation, and
offered his apologies with lively gestures. He said
that my papers proved quite clearly that I was a
Netherland journalist. He declined to allow any
further examination, and gave the peremptory order
that everything that had been taken away from me
should be returned at once. When I had put
everything in my pockets, he asked:</p>

<p>"Have they given you back everything?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," I replied, "excepting my pocket-knife."</p>

<p>"Where is that knife?" Von Manteuffel asked
the sergeant who had fetched my belongings.</p>

<p>"But that is a weapon, general!"</p>

<p>"Return that knife at once!"</p>

<p>The general expatiated once more on the francs-tireurs
of Louvain, and asked me to explain in my
papers without fail that the citizens had to thank
themselves for what had happened. The sergeant
who had taken me to him was ordered to escort me,
that I might not have any further trouble with
the soldiers in the city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span></p>

<p>I started on my return journey to The Netherlands
sick to death. The consequences of lying on
that wet floor made themselves badly felt, and
besides being quite stiff and chilly, my interior was
badly out of order.</p>

<p>Many refugees returned to Louvain that morning
simply driven by hunger. I myself lived still on
the breakfast I had at Maastricht on the previous
day, and badly wanted something to eat, but still
more a cup of hot coffee, to warm my chilled body.
I was able to get the coffee&mdash;without milk or sugar&mdash;from
a peasant along the road, but food was out
of the question. Most of the people had nothing
left, others saved a piece of bread as hard as a brick
for the moment when hunger might drive them to
extreme distress. Whatever sums I offered, nothing
could be had before I came to Tirlemont, where I
was able to buy three eggs.</p>

<p>I had a rather amusing meeting at Tongres,
with a Netherland colleague, who was on his way
to Louvain.</p>

<p>"Where do you come from?" was his first
question.</p>

<p>"From Louvain!"</p>

<p>"Have you been there already? I am going there
too. How are things there?"</p>

<p>"Have you got anything for me to eat?" I
asked, not heeding his words.</p>

<p>I said it quite innocently, without any other
desire beyond that of taking off the edge of my
really trying hunger. But the effect of my question
was surprising indeed. He looked at me dumbfounded,
and asked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span></p>

<p>"But where did you stay then during the
night?"</p>

<p>"I have been arrested."</p>

<p>"And did you not get anything to eat?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>He was back in The Netherlands before me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

LOUVAIN UNDER THE MAILED FIST</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day at Maastricht I tried to cure the
evil results of that night on the damp floor in Louvain
by eating great quantities of rice and drinking
much cocoa with liberal doses of cinnamon, but
as it was of no avail, I started again the next morning.</p>

<p>The majority of the refugees returning to Louvain
belonged to the lower classes, and they began
to loot and plunder the town, encouraged thereto
by the German soldiers, who threw the things into
the streets, and said: "Take it, if you like!" In
extenuation of the looting and plundering I might
say that the poor wretches tried before all to get
hold of half-burned eatables.</p>

<p>During my first visit I estimated the number of
civilian victims at about eighty. This number
turned out to be larger, as many during the second
fire fled to their cellars, exits of which were however
choked up by the collapsing walls. The corpses
of numerous suffocated citizens were found in these
cellars.</p>

<p>At many monasteries I heard painful details of
the treatment suffered by priests. The majority
were made prisoners, and many were tied to trees
during a whole night and afterwards released.
Several were killed. I heard, for example, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
convent of the Jesuits that a student of theology,
Eugène Dupiereux, had been murdered, simply
because he was found to have kept a diary of the war
in which he had expressed a rather unfavourable
opinion about the Germans. In the same manner
two Josephite brothers were murdered, who later
on were found to be Germans; of other priests who
had been killed, the names were not yet known.</p>

<p>Many clerical gentlemen connected with the
University had been ill-treated in the most atrocious
manner. The architect Lenertz, a native of
Luxemburg, also connected with the University, had
been shot, for no reason at all, before the eyes of his
wife at the moment that he left the house. And
Louvain was so effectively cut off from the outer
world that in most convents I was asked whether
the rumour was true that the Pope was dead! And
at that time his successor had already been appointed.</p>

<p>I succeeded in laying my hands on an original
copy of a proclamation that ought not to have
been posted before the following day. I took the
document with me to The Netherlands, and it is
of special interest, because in it the Germans admit
to have tyrannised the people, and to have not only
burned Louvain, but also ransacked the town. The
proclamation had been drawn up in concert with the
German authorities and was approved by them.
It was in French and in Flemish, and read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center">"PROCLAMATION</p>

<p class="center"><i>"To the inhabitants of the City of Louvain</i></p>

<p>"We have in vain visited our municipal representatives.
The last of them, Alderman Schmidt, who was prevented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
from fulfilling his office, surrendered to us the municipal
power on August 30th.</p>

<p>"I believe that it is my duty to take that task upon me,
assisted by some well-known burgesses, who have undertaken
to stand by me.</p>

<p>"In agreement with the German Military authority I
invite the inhabitants of Louvain to return to the city, and
to take up again their usual occupations.</p>

<p>"The orders issued by Monsieur Collins remain valid.</p>

<p>"I mention more especially:&mdash;</p>

<ul><li>"1. That it is prohibited to be out of doors after seven
o'clock (Belgian time) in the evening.</li>

<li>"2. That all who are in possession of any arms, of whatever
description, or any munition must at once deliver everything
at the town-hall.</li>

<li>"3. That everything that may appear hostile to the German
army must be avoided with the utmost care.</li></ul>

<p>"<i>The German military authority have promised us that on
these conditions no further burning and looting shall take place
and that the population shall no longer be threatened or embarrassed.</i></p>

<p>"We are engaged now most actively upon the re-establishment
of the municipal services: Police, Municipal Register,
and the Services of the Canals, which services will all be
reopened as soon as possible.</p>

<p>"The police service will be performed in the daytime by
some volunteers, who will wear an armlet in the municipal
colours, and an identity card, both officially stamped. Well-minded
persons, who are willing to perform these duties, are
urgently requested to present themselves at the town-hall
to-day at four o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span></p>

<p>Pastor Claes, mentioned in the above proclamation,
has done very much for the miserable Louvain
population; they owe him especially much
gratitude for an act of devotion with regard to the
murdered victims.</p>

<p>In the immediate neighbourhood of the railway
station a house was being built, of which only the
foundations were laid. The place showed nothing
beyond a huge cavity. I had noticed already several
times that there was an atrocious stench near the
station, which at last became unendurable. Pastor
Claes, who courageously entered all destroyed houses
to look for the dead, had discovered the victims also
in this place. In the cave just mentioned he found
sixteen corpses of burghers, two priests among
them. In order to remove them from the street
the Germans had simply thrown them into that
cave, without covering the corpses in any way.
They had been lying there for days, and were
decaying rapidly.</p>

<p>I witnessed Pastor Claes's labours for a moment
only, for the smell was unbearable even at a somewhat
considerable distance. The good pastor persevered
in the work after having started it, with the assistance
of some faithful helpers, who all of them had
sealed their mouths with a sponge soaked in some
disinfectant. The corpses were taken from the cave,
money and documents put away in separate bags,
and the unfortunate owners coffined and blessed.</p>

<p>During the next days I found a hospitable domicile
at the convent of the Sacred Heart on the Namur
Canal ("Naamsche Vest"). It is a seminary for
missionaries, and when I went to them for the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
time I had a letter from their head, the "provincial"
in The Netherlands, who sent the order that all
the theological students should be transferred to
The Netherlands as quickly as possible. They
received me with the greatest kindness, and ever
since I enjoyed their hospitality.</p>

<p>A short time after the destruction I was even
obliged to accept it for a whole week, as on the
same day on which I arrived in Louvain for another
visit there was renewed fighting round the town.
The Belgians had advanced as far as Rotselair, where
the next day they held their ground against overwhelmingly
superior numbers; but at last they had
to retire, leaving a great many dead behind. The
Belgians had even got on to the road Tirlemont-Louvain,
and blown up the railway line in two places.</p>

<p>On that occasion the Germans arrested me at
about two miles from Tirlemont. Firstly, because
I travelled by bicycle, and secondly, because I was
accused of having "cooked" one of my passports.</p>

<p>This was so far true that I had altered the dates
of a passport, which allowed me to stay in Louvain
from September 6th till the 14th, into the 8th and
the 16th. When taken to the commanding officer
in Tirlemont, I convinced him so thoroughly of my
complete innocence, that the next day I was allowed
to go on to Louvain.</p>

<p>There the German authorities detained me for a
full week, by prohibiting me to return: "for the sake
of your own safety," they told me courteously.
During the day I was busy enough, and in the evenings
I enjoyed the pleasant company of the three
fathers of the Sacred Heart who had remained in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
mission house, and with whose photographic instrument
I took many a snapshot of the Louvain ruins.</p>

<p>The mission house had become a sanctuary for a
good many people. As bread was lacking, two
brothers fried pancakes all day long and distributed
them among the numberless persons who asked for
food. Among these were people who a few days
earlier belonged to the well-to-do, but who saw their
business, in which often more than their own capital
was invested, wrecked by fire, and were now obliged
to appeal to the charity of these monks. Indeed
during the first weeks after that terrible event many
starved, and I assisted often at the distribution of
the pancakes, because they were short-handed.</p>

<p>In this grand old monastery, both inside and
out a jewel of architecture, about five hundred
people had found shelter. They were lodged in
halls, rooms, and kitchens. The fathers gave them
everything in the way of food they might require,
but they had to do their own cooking. As not one
of these people had a home left, which they could call
their own, no wonder that they greatly admired the
fathers. Often when I strolled about with one of
these, one or other of the refugees came to him to
press his hand and express gratitude for the hospitality
offered.</p>

<p>In this way I got into conversation with a middle-aged
lady. Her husband had been shot, and she got
a bullet in her arm, which had to be amputated in
consequence. The poor creature had lost all
courage, and lived on her nerves only. It was
remarkable to hear this father find the right words,
and succeed in making her calm and resigned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
Before she left us, she had promised that for her
children's sake she would do all in her power to
control herself.</p>

<p>During the week of my compulsory stay in Louvain
I had also the privilege of making the acquaintance
of two brave compatriots; I mean Professor
Noyons and his wife.</p>

<p>They never left Louvain. On August 25th information
was sent to the Leo XIII Institution for
Philosophy, a building turned into a hospital, that
a hundred wounded men might be expected towards
evening. That evening began the wild shooting
and burning of houses by the Germans, and soon a
large number of wounded was taken to the Institution.
Suddenly Professor Noyons recognised one
of his servants among the wounded who were
brought to him for treatment. She had three bullets
in her side. After having bandaged her wounds,
he hurried away to his house, in order to see what
had happened.</p>

<p>He thought that it was sufficiently protected by
the immense Red Cross flag, and the words written
on the door by the Germans themselves: "Professor
Noyons, Netherland physician, to be spared." But
he had been mistaken. The soldiers did not respect
anything, and had forced an entry into the house,
wounded that servant, and then wrecked everything
in the most scandalous manner. Beautiful large
Japanese jars had been smashed to pieces, valuable
furniture damaged by knocking and breaking large
pieces out of it with rifles and bayonets. A fine
carpet was burned, as well as many pieces of furniture.
A hole was burned even in the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span></p>

<p>Professor Noyons took me over the house and
showed me the destruction. Bullets had been
lodged in the inner walls after piercing the windows
and on a level with the windows. By lengthening
the line of trajection one found that the bullets
must have been fired at a distance of nearly six
hundred yards, which proves that the Germans
simply fired at random.</p>

<p>As Professor Noyons heard that other hospitals,
churches, and ancient buildings were not spared
either, he went to the commanding officer through
the rain of bullets, clad in his white overalls, to
claim protection for everything that lawfully displayed
the Red Cross flag, and to request that
churches, convents, ancient buildings, and especially
the town-hall should be spared. It is only owing
to his intervention that not much more was destroyed
in Louvain.</p>

<p>On the Thursday of the week of destruction the
inhabitants were notified that they had to leave the
town, but Professor Noyons and his wife decided to
stay on, as they could not leave the one hundred and
fifty wounded men who were laid up at the Institution.</p>

<p>They carried all those patients into the cellars on
stretchers, and there waited with the nursing staff
for the bombardment that had been announced,
but never came off.</p>

<p>Professor Noyons took me all over the hospital,
and if I should describe all I saw and heard there,
that story alone would fill volumes. He took me,
for example, to a boy of eight years old, whose
shoulder was shattered by rifle-shots. His father and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
mother, four little brothers and a sister, had been
murdered. The boy himself was saved because they
thought that he was dead, whereas he was only
unconscious. When I asked for his parents, brothers
and sister, he put up his one hand and, counting by
his little fingers, he mentioned their names.</p>

<p>There lay also a woman, with one leg amputated.
Her husband had been murdered, another bullet
had entered the leg of the baby in her arms. Another
woman had her child murdered in her arms.</p>

<p>Women and children had frequently been ill-treated
in a most atrocious manner, aged and sick
people were dragged out of the houses, and flung
down in the street. This happened, for example, to
an old man, who lay dying in his cellar. In spite
of the supplications of his wife and two sons, he was
flung on the cobbles, where he died soon. The
sons were taken prisoners and sent away. His
widow assists at present nursing other unfortunates
at Professor Noyons' hospital.</p>

<p>A paralysed woman who had also been flung
into the street was nursed at the hospital, and
lay with many others in the chapel of the Institution,
which had been turned into a ward.</p>

<p>Belgian and German soldiers found excellent
nursing here. Many convalescents were allowed
to walk in the large garden, which was happily
divided by a large wall, so that the one-time combatants
could be separated.</p>

<p>Professor and Mrs. Noyons were busy day and
night on behalf of their fellow-men, and one could
quite well tell by their looks that they were overworked.
They took their rest in the kitchen, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
was built in the basement. All male and female
voluntary nurses took their meals there.</p>

<p>Once I enjoyed the pleasure of partaking of such a
"dinner," as the guest of Professor and Mrs.
Noyons. The company was very mixed, and men
who never in their lives had ever done anything else
but spoiling their eyes for the sake of science, by
reading all manner of ancient manuscripts, were now
busy, dressed in a blue apron, stirring the soup and
mashing potatoes or vegetables. The menu comprised
nothing but potatoes, a little vegetables, and
a finely calculated piece of meat.</p>

<p>At that dinner I also made the acquaintance of
Professor Nerincx, the acting burgomaster. It was
a courageous act to assume the government of the
town destroyed by the Germans; he did it for the
sake of his fellow-citizens, who will never be able to
requite their indebtedness to the temporary burgomaster
for what he did for them; and most of them
do not even know it.</p>

<p>The war is not over yet, and much is still hidden
under a veil, but after the war it will undoubtedly
be the duty of the Louvain people to twine a magnificent
wreath round the three names Noyons-Nerincx-Claes.</p>

<p>The names of many priests will be found in the
register of Belgian martyrs. I have mentioned
already some who, although innocent, gave their
life for their country. During my week's stay at
Louvain I heard of other cases. The priest of
Corbeek-Loo, for example, was simply tortured to
death on account of one of his sermons in which he
said that the fight of the Belgian army was beauti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>ful
"because it lawfully resists an unlawful invasion,"
and further for announcing a Holy Requiem
Mass for the souls of the "murdered" citizens.</p>

<p>At Blauwput, near Louvain, where, according to
the Germans, there had been also shooting, many
houses were set on fire and the men placed in a row.
It was then announced that by way of punishment
every fifth man would be shot. When the Germans
counted as tenth the father of a large family, that
man fainted, and they simply killed number eleven,
a Capuchin.</p>

<p>Very many other cases of martyrdom among
priests remained unknown to me, but the various
Belgian bishops examined all these events with
praiseworthy zeal and scrupulousness, and by taking
extensive evidence established the fact that in no
case the victims could be reproached with any act
that justified the sentence against them. After
the war the world will surely be made acquainted
with the horrible truth.</p>

<p class="p2">The foregoing record of my experiences in
Louvain will make it sufficiently clear to the unprejudiced
reader that the destruction and wholesale
murders were nothing but wanton crimes committed
by the German troops stationed there,
crimes which it is impossible to justify on any ground.</p>

<p>The duration of the war has more or less surprised
me, and I postponed writing this book for a long
time as I wished to quote the evidence of persons
in high places, clergymen, and educated foreigners.
As the war is not over yet, I must omit these in the
interest of their safety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span></p>

<p>But from my personal knowledge and the evidence
referred to, I am able to establish the following
facts in connection with the events that preceded
and followed the destruction of Louvain.</p>

<p>On August 25th the Antwerp garrison made a
sortie, in the direction of Louvain. At the beginning
the Belgians were successful, and came within four
and a half miles of this town. For a moment the
situation became critical, and at about seven o'clock
a small troop of cavalry came at a furious gallop
from the scene of battle to Louvain, probably to
summon the assistance of the garrison.</p>

<p>At that hour the Namur Canal ("Naamsche Vest")
was already dark in consequence of the thick foliage
of tall trees, and suddenly the wild horsemen were
shot at. Several neutral witnesses established the
fact that this was done by a small troop of German
infantry who came from the station, probably on
their way to the battle-field, and thought that
Belgian cavalry came racing into the town.</p>

<p>The men stopped their horses, dismounted, and
returned the fire from behind their animals. This
went on for about a quarter of an hour. Every
one was alarmed by this shooting; other soldiers
came racing in from the station, and others ran to
and fro near that building crying, "A surprise
attack!" Some, thinking that the attack came from
the advancing Belgians, rushed to the place where
the fighting took place, others misunderstood the
cry, believed that the citizens assaulted them, and
began to shoot at these, and at the houses.</p>

<p>Before those on the Naamsche Vest found out
their mistake, the shooting was going on in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
greater part of the town, and the excited men, who
at first had been shooting at each other, soon joined
the rest. Some wounded troopers were taken to
one of the convents on the Vest, but a couple of
hours later they were suddenly fetched away again.</p>

<p>The whole evening and the next day the Germans
went on shooting people and firing houses. It is
worth recording that the library was already set
on fire that same evening of the fray on the Naamsche
Vest; it was burning at eight o'clock.</p>

<p>On Thursday everyone, even the persons staying in
the Institution and hospitals, were ordered to leave
the town, as it was to be shelled. They seemed to
have no pity even on the wretched wounded men.
Only the male and female nurses remained with
these, of their own free will, determined to die with
them if necessary.</p>

<p>The inhabitants were driven to the station, where
the husbands were cruelly separated from their
wives and several persons were shot. Other men
were escorted to a place behind the station, and
their wives and children were told that those men
were going to be shot. The poor things heard
indeed the click-clack of the rifles and thought that
their dear ones were dead. However, many returned
later, and their "shooting" seems to have
been a mere sham.</p>

<p>Great crowds walked the long way to Tirlemont.
They were constantly threatened by German soldiers,
who aimed their rifles at them; passing officers
commanded from time to time that some should
stay behind, and others were shot. Especially did
the clerics amongst the refugees suffer a great deal;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
many were not only scandalously scoffed at, but also
maliciously injured. The greater part of the
Germans showed a strong anti-Catholic bias, in
particular against the clergy, whom they accused
of having incited the people against them.</p>

<p>This is only a short record of the destruction of
Louvain, the truthfulness of which will be firmly
and fully established after the war by extensive,
accurately drawn up declarations.</p>

<p>Louvain had been destroyed because a crowd of
wanton soldiers, who were garrisoned there, who
hated the Belgians, and who had been kept within
bounds with difficulty, seized on their own stupid
mistake to give rein to their passions.</p>

<p>Their commanding officer was the worthy head
of such a mob, a heartless creature, who did not
show the slightest remorse for the destruction of
those magnificent libraries, set on fire <i>by his order</i>.</p>

<p>It has been alleged that civilians had been shooting
from the Halls, but when a committee examined
the remains in the building with the consent of
the military, they found there the carcase of a
German horse. They were ordered to stop their
investigations immediately, for that horse was
evidence ... that German military men had been
billeted on the building, and thus no civilians could
have been there. This will also be published later
in the reports.</p>

<p>The German authority left indeed no effort
untried to cover up their atrocious action. Already
in a communication from Wolff, dated August 29th,
they attempted to violate the truth by asserting
that:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span></p>

<p>"The houses caught fire from burning benzine,
and the flames burst out in other quarters also.
On Wednesday afternoon part of the town and the
northern suburb were in flames."</p>

<p>They have not been able to maintain that story
for very long; the truth overtook the lie.</p>

<p>May all the nations of the world after the war
collaborate to compensate Louvain for her martyrdom,
see that this city shall be restored to her
former, happy prosperity, and get a library which
approaches as much as possible the one she lost.
The Germans can probably do their part by investigating
where the motor-cars went which left
the Halls on that wretched Tuesday night, heavily
laden with books.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />

ALONG THE MEUSE TO HUY, ANDENNE,
AND NAMUR</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Between</span> two of my several trips to Louvain I made
one to Namur in the beginning of September, after
having secured at Liège, by a trick, a splendid permit
which enabled me to travel even by motor-car.</p>

<p>There was a little more order in the whole
district round Liège, since the Germans behaved
more decently, and provisions had arrived. The
shock, which the burning and butchering of so
many places and persons gave to the whole world,
had also influenced the conduct of the Germans,
and from the beginning of September they made
a practice of asking each time when they thought
that they had behaved decently: "Well, are we
such barbarians as the world calls us?"</p>

<p>In this relative calm the population felt somewhat
relieved, and ventured again into the streets. Outdoors
on the "stoeps" of the houses men sat on
their haunches smoking their pipe and playing a
game of piquet. Most of them were vigorous
fellows, miners, who did not mind any amount
of work, but now came slowly under the demoralising
influence of idleness.</p>

<p>My motor whirled along the gloriously fine road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
to Huy. It is a delicious tour through the beautiful
valley of the Meuse, along sloping light-green roads.
Had the circumstances not been so sad, I should
have enjoyed it better.</p>

<p>I had already been near Huy, at a time when
several burning houses shrouded the whole town in
clouds of smoke. On August 24th, at ten o'clock
at night, some shots had been fired in the neighbourhood
of the viaduct. This was a sign for hundreds
of soldiers to begin shooting at random and arrest
several persons. Several houses were perforated
like sieves by bullets, and an entire street of twenty-eight
houses, the Rue du Jardin, was reduced to
ashes. No civilians were killed.</p>

<p>It is evident from the "Report on the Violations
of International Law in Belgium" that the Germans
themselves admit that they were in the wrong with
regard to the atrocities which were committed here.
The following order of the day proves it:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Last night a shooting affray took place. There is no
evidence that the inhabitants of the towns had any arms in
their houses, nor is there evidence that the people took part
in the shooting; on the contrary, it seems that the soldiers
were under the influence of alcohol, and began to shoot in a
senseless fear of a hostile attack.</p>

<p>"The behaviour of the soldiers during the night, with very
few exceptions, makes a scandalous impression.</p>

<p>"It is highly deplorable when officers or non-commissioned
officers set houses on fire without the permission or order of
the commanding, or, as the case may be, the senior officer, or
when by their attitude they encourage the rank and file to
burn and plunder.</p>

<p>"I require that everywhere a strict investigation shall take
place into the conduct of the soldiers with regard to the life
and property of the civilian population.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
"I prohibit all shooting in the towns without the order of
an officer.</p>

<p>"The miserable behaviour of the men has been the cause
that a non-commissioned officer and a private were seriously
wounded by German ammunition.</p>

<p class="right">
"The Commanding Officer,<br />

"<span class="smcap">Major Von Bassewitz</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>I was informed further that there had been no
fighting for the possession of Huy. The citadel
on which the German flag flew had not been put
in a state of defence on account of its great age.
The old bridge over the Meuse at Huy had been
wrecked by the Belgians, but the Germans had
simply driven stout piles into the river, to support
a floor which they put over the wrecked part, and
so restored the traffic.</p>

<p>During my visit I happened to make the acquaintance
of Mr. Derricks, a brother of the lawyer who
had been murdered so cruelly at Canne, and also
a member of the Provincial States. The poor man
was deeply moved when he heard the details about
his brother's death. I made him very happy by
taking a letter with me for his sister-in-law, who
was now at Maastricht.</p>

<p>At Andenne things seemed much worse than at
Huy. I stopped there on my way to Namur, and
had been prepared in Liège for the sad things I
should hear. A proclamation posted in the last-named
town ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">
"<i>August 22nd</i>, 1914.
</p>

<p>"After having protested their peaceful sentiments the
inhabitants of Andenne made a treacherous attack on our
troops.</p>

<p>"The Commanding General burned down the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
city with my consent, shooting also about one hundred
persons.</p>

<p>"I acquaint the inhabitants of Liège of this, that they may
understand what fate threatens them if they should assume
a similar attitude.</p>

<p class="right">
"The Commanding General-in-chief,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Von Buelow</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>General von Buelow says here that he gave his
consent to the shooting of about one hundred
persons, but I can state with absolute certainty that
there were about 400 victims. We must therefore
assume that the other 300 were killed without his
consent.</p>

<p>Andenne, on the right bank of the Meuse, was
a town of 8,000 inhabitants. When the Germans
arrived there on the morning of August 19th they
found the bridge connecting Andenne and Seilles
wrecked. In the afternoon they began building
a pontoon bridge, which was ready the next day.
They were very much put out about the wrecking
of the other bridge, by the Belgian soldiers, a couple
of hours before their arrival. Their exasperation
became still greater when they discovered after
having finished the pontoon bridge, that the big
tunnel on the left bank of the Meuse had also been
made useless by barricades and entanglements.</p>

<p>By refusing to pay at cafés and shops the military
already expressed their dissatisfaction. Then on
Thursday, August 20th, about six in the evening,
after a great many troops had crossed the river by
the pontoon bridge, a shot was heard which seemed
the sign for a terrible fusillade. Guns seemed to
have been mounted at convenient places outside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
the town, for shells exploded right at its centre.
The troops did no longer cross the bridge, but spread
themselves in a disorderly manner all over the town,
constantly shooting at the windows. Even mitrailleuses
were brought into action. Those of the
inhabitants who could fly did so, but many were
killed in the streets and others perished by bullets
entering the houses through the windows. Many
others were shot in the cellars, for the soldiers forced
their way in, in order to loot the bottles of wine
and to swallow their fill of liquor, with the result
that very soon the whole garrison was a tipsy mob.</p>

<p>It struck me always that as soon as something
took place anywhere which might lead to disorder,
the method adopted was as follows: first a fusillade
in order to scare the inhabitants, secondly looting
of numberless bottles of wine, and finally cruel,
inhuman murders, the ransacking and the wrecking.</p>

<p>The game of shooting and looting went on all
through the night of the 20th. Not a window or
door remained whole even if the house was not
burned down altogether.</p>

<p>At four o'clock in the morning all the men, women,
and children who had not yet been put to death
were driven to the Place des Tilleuls, but on the
way many men had their brains blown out. Amongst
others, Dr. Camus, the septuagenarian burgomaster,
was then wounded and afterwards received the
finishing stroke by a hatchet.</p>

<p>At the Place des Tilleuls fifty men were taken
from the crowd at random, escorted to the Meuse,
and shot. In the meantime other soldiers went on
wrecking, firing, and looting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span></p>

<p>Andenne offered a dismal spectacle. The doors
and windows of the houses that were not completely
burned down had been kicked and beaten to
pieces, and boards had been nailed before the holes.
The inhabitants hung about disconsolately, and I
could tell by their faces how they suffered, for
every family in the town mourned the death of one
dear to them.</p>

<p>They all became excited whenever I mentioned the
accusations brought against them. They asserted
with the greatest emphasis that it was an absolute
lie that the civilians had shot. "Even if they
torture me to death," said most of them, "I'll
still contend that this accusation is untrue."</p>

<p>The German officers, of course, held a different
opinion; they alleged that the shooting by the
civilians was even very general and purported to
be a decided attack on the army. I asked them
whether they had found any rifles or other arms at
the "searches" of the houses&mdash;I expressed myself
somewhat cautiously on purpose&mdash;for that ought
to have been the case if such a great number of
citizens had joined in the shooting. "No," they
answered, "they were sly enough to see to it that
we did not find these. They had been buried in
time, of course."</p>

<p>The answer is, surely, not very convincing!</p>

<p>The Germans had flung some more bridges across
the river beyond Andenne, which had been used
for the occupation of Namur chiefly, and lay idle
now guarded by only one sentry. I left by the
town-gate without any difficulties; the German
soldiers jumped out of the way and stood to atten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>tion,
as soon as they noticed the Netherland flag
flying at the front of the motor. To the right and
the left of the gateway they had written in gigantic
letters: "Newspapers, please!"</p>

<p>Namur was shelled on August 21st and the 23rd.
Many houses were then already wrecked, many
civilians killed. On the 23rd the Belgian army
withdrew and only some of the forts were defended.
This withdrawal of the Belgian army may have
been a strategical necessity, but it is certain that
the forts had not been defended unto the last.
Five forts fell into the hands of the Germans without
having suffered any damage.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 23rd the hostile troops
entered the town, and on that day the inhabitants
had not to suffer, excepting from requisitions made.
But the following evening it was suddenly on fire at
various spots, and the soldiers began to shoot in all
directions, making many victims. Before setting
the houses on fire, with a liberal use of the lozenges
mentioned already, the usurpers ransacked them and
removed numerous pieces of valuable furniture.
The Place d'Armes, the Place Léopold, the Rue
St. Nicolas, Rue Rogier, and the Avenue de la
Plante were almost entirely reduced to ashes.
With the town-hall many valuable pictures were
destroyed. The day following the conflagration
they left off shooting at last, but the looting went
on for days more.</p>

<p>When I drove into Namur, I found the town
comparatively quiet; there was some traffic in the
streets, and Belgian army surgeons and British
nurses in their uniforms walked about freely.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
There were many wounded: the German wounded
were all placed in the military hospital; the Belgians
and the French had been taken to the Sisters of
Mercy, the Institution Saint Louis, the High School
for Girls, and the Sisters of Our Lady.</p>

<p>When I was eating a little at one of the hotels
near the railway station, I was offered the newspaper
<i>l'Ami de l'Ordre</i>, which had appeared again
for the first time on that day, September 7th, under
the Censorship of the German authorities. For
curiosity's sake I translate here the first leaderette,
published under the rule of the new masters:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"ENOUGH DESTROYED, ENOUGH DISTRESSED!</p>

<p>"More than one hundred houses have been burned or
wrecked at Namur, among them the town-hall, the house
at the Namur Citadel, and the Institution for ophthalmology
in the Place Léopold. In the Grand Marché and its neighbourhood
about sixty have been destroyed by fire. If we add
to this the damage done by the bombardment from Friday
the 21st until Sunday the 23rd August, and the wrecking of
the bridges after the retreat of the army, we may estimate
the losses at 10,000,000 francs.</p>

<p>"Industry, trade, and agriculture exist no longer, labour
is unemployed, and food is getting scarce, and over this dismal
scene hovers the memory of numerous victims, of hundreds of
prisoners of war or missing soldiers. During the bombardment
of August 23rd one hundred persons were killed outright,
or succumbed to their wounds. There are innumerable
other wounded. This it is plain must have plunged the town
into deep distress.</p>

<p>"It mourns the lost liberty, the happiness, the peace, the
brightness of her past prosperity which has vanished for a
long season to come, it laments on account of the prisoners
of war, the wounded, the dead.... And every morning the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
brilliant sun rises on the scene, the warm rays bathe town and
country, both alike cruelly lashed by the frightful scourge.</p>

<p>"Yesterday crowds of believers prayed for peace, for that
blessing which is only valued when it is lost. Let us repeat
our supplications twofold, let us increase our zeal. Lord!
O Lord! listen to the voice of Thy people who pray to Thee!
Be merciful! Give us back our peace!"</p></blockquote>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />

FROM MAASTRICHT TO THE FRENCH
FRONTIER</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Destruction of Dinant</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Adventures</span> incite to ever more risky undertakings,
and we long constantly for more sensation. Such
an experience prompted me to an arrangement with
Mr. Tervooren, editor of <i>Het Leven</i>, to try to
motor to the French frontier.</p>

<p>We left Maastricht, in the early morning of
September 9th, with a smart fellow as chauffeur.
Louvain we found tolerably quiet, although fearful
scenes were witnessed in the search for corpses,
which were found in the cellars of many houses.</p>

<p>On that day I saw for the first time in Belgium
German sailors and marines, and even an admiral
and some officers. At that time the appearance
of the naval men gave the newspapers much room
for conjectures; it was found later that they were
to be used in the attack on Antwerp, and afterwards
had the task allotted to them of occupying the
sea-board.</p>

<p>I found sailors also in Brussels, but for the rest
there was only a little military display there. In
this town reigned a certain oppressive silence and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
the cafés were not much frequented. The Brussels
people did not hide their patriotic sentiments, and
nearly every house displayed the Belgian flag,
thanks chiefly to the strong attitude of Burgomaster
Max. Outwardly Brussels had not suffered by the
war; not a house was damaged and nobody had
been killed yet. Nor was there lack of provisions,
as was proved by the fact that at the "Métropole,"
one of the largest restaurants, I paid only seventy-five
centimes (sevenpence-halfpenny) for bread,
cold beef, and pickles.</p>

<p>We met only a few Germans on the road from
Brussels to Charleroi, and found no garrison except
in the townlet Hal. Very little burning had taken
place on this road, but so much the more plundering
and looting. A woman took us all over her
house in the neighbourhood of Brussels, to show us
the total wrecking. Small pieces of furniture were
generally taken away, but stoves, kitcheners, and
cupboards were smashed. She herself had had her
face badly wounded, because she had hidden herself
in the cellar when the Germans came near, and
they had beaten her out of that with their rifle-butts.
Many other women were treated in the
same manner.</p>

<p>When we came to Jumet, a suburb of Charleroi,
and a prosperous place with flourishing factories,
we found the whole town wrecked.... Nearly
all the houses were burned immediately after the
occupation by the Germans, and many inhabitants
were killed, of course under the pretext that they
had been shooting.</p>

<p>After driving through this scene of misery we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
entered Charleroi, and exactly at that moment one
of the springs of my motor broke in two, which made
the car useless. Charleroi seemed worse damaged
than Namur. According to an official statement
issued at the time, one hundred and sixty-five
houses had been burned, among them many on the
fine Boulevard Audent, the Saint Joseph Institute,
the convent of the Sœurs de Namur, and the adjacent
ancient, miraculous little chapel of "Sainte
Marie des Remparts."</p>

<p>Probably more than one hundred civilians had
been shot, whereas many perished in the cellars.
The heads of the municipality and several priests
had at first been taken as hostages. Bail of ten
million francs was asked for their release, but after
much haggling they consented to accept one and a
half millions, which sum was forthcoming from
the various local banks.</p>

<p>Just as at Louvain and other towns, the Germans
indulged in looting and plundering also at Charleroi;
and probably this explains why here too the finest
houses were destroyed. Moreover, many atrocious
cases of rape occurred here as at Dinant, about
which town more anon. At a café, where the proprietor
unburdened his mind to me, with tears in
his eyes, I read a statement in which they were
impudent enough to write that they had passed a
pleasant night in circumstances described in detail,
whilst the father had been locked up.</p>

<p>Charleroi was taken on August 22nd. On the
evening of the 21st a small patrol had entered the
town, and of these not a man escaped. But in the
morning of the 22nd at seven o'clock a large force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
of Germans arrived and immediately began to burn
and to shoot.</p>

<p>On the day of my stay at Charleroi, at about
seven o'clock in the evening, there was a good deal
of bustle round about the station, many trains from
Maubeuge arriving. One of these trains was entirely
filled by officers of the garrison who had been
taken prisoner. Another carried only wounded
Germans, lying on light stretchers, on which they
were transported through the streets to the hospitals
at Charleroi. Many had fearful wounds,
and convulsively held their hands on the injured
parts, while others lay still, the pallor of death on
their face. Maubeuge must have cost the Germans
enormous sacrifices, as for many of the wretched
wounded no room could be found at Charleroi,
and they had to be taken farther by train, to Namur
or Brussels.</p>

<p>German officials told that immediately after
the surrender Maubeuge had been set on fire in
various places, because civilians, etc.... The
reader is by now able to complete the sentence.</p>

<p>After I had collected some information in the
town and my colleague of <i>Het Leven</i> had taken
several snapshots, we thought that it was time to
look for lodgings and to get our motor-car repaired.</p>

<p>We found rooms, but were guarded during the
night by soldiers, who walked up and down the landing,
because there were officers also staying at the
hotel. Their regular footfall prevented us from
sleeping a wink, but with the help of some fibs and
Netherland cigars we induced them to let us go out,
and we went to a sort of smith in a kind of garage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
to repair the motor-car. We turned up our sleeves
and, assisted by the smith's technical directions,
succeeded in putting the broken spring together,
using stout steel clamps and screws.</p>

<p>Before leaving we went back to the hotel for
breakfast. There&mdash;it was a first-class hotel&mdash;they
gave us an apology for coffee, without milk or sugar,
and two flimsy pieces of bread, as hard as wood and
as black as shoe-polish. I was intensely hungry,
and as nowhere at Charleroi anything else could
be had, I did my best with the wooden bread and
succeeded in washing it down with much chewing
and jawing. But the sweet, hard stuff did not suit
my digestion, and I felt ill already when at six
o'clock we got into the motor-car and left for Dinant.</p>

<p>We could not keep to the main road all the time,
for it was forbidden by proclamation to go farther
than nine miles and a half from the town, and we
should have been stopped without fail.</p>

<p>We first drove through the suburb Montigny-sur-Sambre,
which shared the fate of Jumet, and was
entirely destroyed by fire. After leaving the town
we went in the direction of Châtelet, where we
found an immense battle-field. Terrific fighting
must have taken place here, for the number of
buried was enormous. On a wide stretch of land
we saw a great number of mounds, with crosses,
and covered with quicklime. On the crosses the
numbers are given of the brave who fell there. So
I read, for example:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="center">
"Here rest 10 soldiers, French, I. Reg. 36.
fell 22.8. R.I.P."</p>
<p class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
"Here rest 23 soldiers, German, I.R. 78. and
91. fell 22.8.14.  R.I.P."</p>

<p class="center">"Here rest 7 officers, German, I.R. fell 22.8.14.
R.I.P."</p>

<p class="center">"Here rest 140 soldiers, French, I.R. 36. fell 22.8.
R.I.P."
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There were very many similar ones, but I copied
only these, because they lay just near the road;
farther on there were numerous other white
mounds with crosses.</p>

<p>The villages Gougnies and Biesmes had been
destroyed also; of the former not one house was
left undamaged; but nothing happened to the
townlet Mettet. Here we were forbidden to go on,
as we were already more than nine miles and a half
from Charleroi. This compelled us to leave the
main road, and to proceed along byways which soon
took us to the Ardennes, where our motor-car
rushed along in zigzags.</p>

<p>From time to time the tour became a break-neck
affair, as the mountain roads were wet and muddy
after much rain, and at corners we were often in
great fear of being hurled down into the depth.
It was a wonderfully fine district of green rock,
although somewhat monotonous after a time, as
it seemed that we were simply moving in a circle,
which impression was strengthened by the fact
that frequently we passed through tunnels and
viaducts which were very alike to one another.</p>

<p>I felt very sick, for the sweet rye-bread which I
had forced down my throat in the morning did not
agree with me at all. At last I felt so ill that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
was obliged to lie down on the floor of the car,
and it took my colleague all his time to convince
me that he did not think that my last hour had
struck.</p>

<p>In the end and in despair I accepted an aspirin
tablet which he had pressed on me a hundred times,
and although I do not know whether it was owing
to that, or in spite of it, it was a fact that I felt
somewhat better.</p>

<p>After touring quite a long while through this
labyrinth, we got at last back to the main road from
Namur to Dinant, near Anhec. Here immediately
we saw proofs of war, drawn from widespread
destruction. The railway bridge across the Meuse
near Houx, so picturesquely situated at the foot of a
high rock, had been blown up.</p>

<p>Bouvigne, a hamlet near Dinant, had suffered
fearfully from the bombardment of that town.
Trees were splintered by the shells, the church was
nearly a total wreck from the same cause, and two
houses by the road had been riddled by bullets into
a sieve, and also damaged by shells. On the whole
scene of war I have not seen one house carrying so
many bullets in it; their holes made the doors look
like wire-netting. In these houses the French had
barricaded themselves, brought mitrailleuses to them,
and defended them until the last. None of those
heroes left them alive. My colleague took many
snapshots of this remarkable spot, while I collected
bullets, fragments of shell, and similar mementos
of this warfield.</p>

<p>In order to give the reader some idea of the
fearful things that happened at Dinant, I insert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
here some quotations from the reports drawn up
by the Belgian Inquiry Committee about the
Violations of International Law, of which I can
affirm the truth word for word, because they are
identical with the information that I got myself
at Dinant.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The destruction took place from August 21st to the
25th.</p>

<p>"On August 15th a fierce fight took place between the
French troops on the left bank of the Meuse and the Germans
who approached from the east. The Germans were defeated,
put to flight, and chased by the French, who crossed the river.
On that day the town was not damaged much. Some houses
were destroyed by German howitzers, which were undoubtedly
aimed at the French regiments on the left bank. One Red
Cross helper who lived at Dinant was killed by a German
bullet when he was taking up one of the wounded.</p>

<p>"The next day all remained quiet, the French keeping the
surrounding places occupied; not one fight took place between
the two armies and nothing happened which might be looked
upon as a hostile action by the populations, and there were
no German troops near Dinant.</p>

<p>"At about nine o'clock of Friday evening, August 21st,
German soldiers arriving by rail from Ciney marched into the
town by the Rue Saint Jacques. They began to shoot into
the windows without the slightest provocation, killed a workman
who was on his way home, wounded another inhabitant
and compelled him to call out: 'Long live the Kaiser.' A
third they wounded in the abdomen with thrusts of their
bayonets. They burst into the cafés, requisitioned all spirits,
got tipsy on them, and left after setting several houses on
fire and knocking to pieces the doors and windows of others.</p>

<p>"The inhabitants, frightened and perplexed, hid themselves
in the houses.</p>

<p>"On Sunday, August 23rd, at half-past six in the morning,
the soldiers of the 108th regiment of the line drove the worshippers
out of the Premonstratensian Church, separated the
men from the women, and shot about fifty of the former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
through the head. Between seven and nine o'clock there were
house-to-house looting and burning by the soldiers, who
chased the inhabitants into the street. Those who tried to
escape were shot off-hand.</p>

<p>"At about nine o'clock the soldiers drove all who had been
found in the houses in front of them by means of blows from
their rifle-butts. They crowded them together in the Place
d'Armes, where they kept them until six o'clock in the
evening. Their guards amused themselves by telling the
men repeatedly that they would soon be shot.</p>

<p>"At six o'clock a captain separated the men from the
women and children. The women were placed behind a line
of infantry. The men had to stand alongside a wall; those
in the first row were ordered to sit on their haunches, the
others to remain standing behind them. A platoon took
a stand straight opposite the group. The women prayed in
vain for mercy for their husbands, their sons, and their brothers;
the officer gave the order to fire. He had not made the
slightest investigation, pronounced no sentence of any sort.</p>

<p>"A score of these men were merely wounded and fell among
the dead. For greater certainty the soldiers fired once more
into the mass. A few got off scot-free in spite of the double
fusillade. For over two hours they pretended to be dead,
remained among the corpses without budging, and when it
was dark were able to fly to the mountains. Eighty-four
victims remained behind and were buried in a garden in the
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>"There were other murders on that same 23rd of August.</p>

<p>"Soldiers discovered inhabitants of the suburb Saint Pierre
in the cellars of a brewery, and killed them on the spot.</p>

<p>"On the previous day many workmen of the silk factory
Kimmer and their wives and children had found a shelter in
the cellars of the building, with some neighbours and relatives
of their employer. At six o'clock in the evening the unfortunate
people made up their mind to leave their hiding-place and
went into the street, headed by a white flag. They were
immediately seized by the soldiers and roughly ill-treated. All
the men were shot, among them Mr. Kimmer, Consul of
Argentina.</p>

<p>"Nearly all the men of the suburb Leffe were massacred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
en masse. In another quarter twelve citizens were murdered
in a cellar. In the Rue en Ile a paralytic was shot in his bath-chair,
and in the Rue d'Enfer a boy, fourteen years old, was
struck down by a soldier.</p>

<p>"The railway viaduct of the suburb Neffe became the
scene of a bloody massacre. An old woman and all her
children were shot in a cellar. A man sixty-five years old,
his wife, a son and a daughter were placed against a wall and
shot through the head. Other inhabitants of Neffe were
placed in a boat, taken to the Rocher Bayard, and shot there;
among them were a woman eighty-three years old and her
husband.</p>

<p>"A number of men and women had been locked in the yard
of the prison.... At six o'clock in the evening a mitrailleuse
was placed on the mountain and fired at them, an old woman
and three others being killed.</p>

<p>"Whilst some soldiers committed these murders, others
looted and wrecked the houses, smashed the safes or blew
them up with dynamite. They forced their way into the
Banque Centrale de la Meuse, seized the manager, Mr. Xavier
Wasseige, and called upon him to open the safe. As he refused
to do so, they tried to force it open, but in vain. Thereupon
they took Mr. Wasseige and his two eldest sons to the Place
d'Armes, where they and 120 of their fellow-citizens were shot
by means of a mitrailleuse. The youngest three children of
Mr. Wasseige were held by soldiers and forced to attend the
slaughter of their father and brothers. We were also informed
that one of the young Wasseiges lay dying for an hour and
nobody dared to come to his assistance.</p>

<p>"After the soldiers had performed their duty as vandals and
bandits they set the houses on fire. Soon the whole town was
one immense pool of fire.</p>

<p>"All the women and children had been taken to a convent,
where they were kept imprisoned for four days, without hearing
of the fate of their beloved ones. They themselves expected
to be shot in their turn. Round about them the burning of
the town went on.</p>

<p>"The first day the religious were allowed to give them
some food, although not sufficient. Soon they had nothing
to eat but carrots and unripe fruit.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
"The inquiry also brought to light that the German soldiers
on the right bank, who were exposed to the fire of the French,
hid themselves here and there behind civilians, women and
children.</p>

<p>"In short the town of Dinant is destroyed. Of 1,400
houses, 200 only remained standing. The factories, where
the labouring population got their bread and butter, were
wrecked systematically. Many inhabitants were sent to Germany,
where they are still kept as prisoners. The majority of
the others are scattered all over Belgium. Those who stayed
in the towns were starved.</p>

<p>"The committee has a list of the victims. It contains
700 names, and is not complete. Among those killed are
seventy-three women and thirty-nine children between six
months and fifteen years old.</p>

<p>"Dinant had 7,600 inhabitants, of whom ten per cent. were
put to death; not a family exists which has not to mourn
the death of some victims; many families have been exterminated
completely."</p></blockquote>

<p>When we entered the town in our motor-car,
those of the unfortunate population who had
escaped from the murderous massacre had already
left the town. Between the ruins and the deserted
French Red Cross cars we drove to the pontoon
bridge which the Germans had flung across the
river by the side of the Meuse bridge, which had
been blown up. Here we were stopped by German
soldiers who guarded the pontoon bridge. In a
café we came across a few of the citizens who had
remained. These unfortunate people had no home,
no money, and no food, lacked the wherewithal to
go farther away, and now depended on the charity
of the murderers of their relatives. Twice a day
they were allowed to call at one of the German stores
for a piece of bread, in exchange for a ticket which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
they might get at the commander's office. The
Germans, upholders of morality and "Kultur," saw
to it that their victims did not overeat themselves.</p>

<p>Our passport had to be stamped by this same
commander, and my colleague had to ask him for
a permit to take photographs. The commander
would not hear of this, but finally agreed, after my
colleague had snapshotted him and his staff in
front of the office. Our passport was marked:
"1. Landsturm Infantry Battalion, Dresden."</p>

<p>Dinant offered a terrible sight; it no longer
existed. On foot, of course, we walked along
the place where a large shop once stood, but one
could not even distinguish where the road had been.
Not one street was left, and the few houses that
were saved are not in the centre of the town. On
a slope on the left bank of the Meuse there had been
two large monasteries, which had been turned into
hospitals. They had been wrecked completely by
gun-fire, and as if in bitter mockery at the cruel
fate, the Red Cross flags flew there still undamaged.</p>

<p>In the centre of the town everything, including
the large buildings, had been levelled with the
ground. This was the case with the principal
church "de Notre Dame," the college of the same
name, the "Belle Vue," the monasteries, etc., of
the "Frères et Sœurs de Notre Dame," the "Saint
Nicolas" and "Saint Pierre" churches, and three
large factories, "Oudin," "Le Mérinos," and "La
Dinant," the "Banque Centrale de la Meuse,"
the town-hall, the ancient "Palace of the Prince-Bishops,"
and all its archives, the magnificent post-and-telegraph
office, the large hotels "de la Tête<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
d'Or," "des Postes," "des Ardennes," "Moderne,"
"Terminus," the hotels "de la Citadelle," "la
Paix," "la Gare," etc., etc., the "Institut Hydrothérapique,"
all houses of the "Bon Secours"
Congregation, etc.</p>

<p>The finest view of Dinant was from the beautiful
bridge affording a passage across the Meuse with
the "Notre Dame" in the background. This
church was built just in front of a steep rock, on
top of which stood the citadel of Dinant.</p>

<p>Now the bridge is blown up, the greater part of
the church destroyed by the Germans, and, had
nature not been more powerful than their brutal,
clumsy violence, they would have pulled down that
rock too. But it is still there, the solitary remnant
of the famous beauty of Dinant.</p>

<p>My companion wanted to take a snapshot of this
point, but in order to enliven the scene somewhat,
he requested a few soldiers to stand in the square
in front of the church. Each had a couple of
champagne bottles hanging on his stomach, and
refused absolutely to accede to my colleague's
request to remove them. They insisted upon being
snapshotted with those bottles hanging on their
bodies! So my companion took this snapshot of
"Kultur" in that condition, houses burned down,
a church destroyed, and in front of these the grinning
and coarse villains, puffing out their bodies, proud
of their empty bottles....</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />

ON THE BATTLE-FIELDS</h2>

<p>As often as I went on tour to collect news on the
scene of war, I got dozens of messages and letters,
which alarmed people sent to the editor of <i>De Tijd</i>,
with the request that they should be handed to
me for further transmission to relatives. I took
hundreds of them to and from Louvain.</p>

<p>On Monday, September 14th, I took with me
a larger number than ever to Louvain.</p>

<p>I observed then already that much poverty
prevailed, for in many places I noticed people
whose appearance did not suggest that they were
accustomed to that sort of work, creeping quietly
in and out of hedges, carrying bags in which they
put the potatoes picked up in the fields. Naturally
they started and looked alarmed, when, suddenly,
I passed on my bicycle.</p>

<p>Round about Louvain everything was prepared for
defensive purposes, artillery being hidden under
straw-roofs, only a few yards away from the farm-houses,
and the sentries were very alert. I never
saw them before I was quite near; then they jumped
suddenly from behind a tree, summoning me to stop
by lowering their rifle. In the meadows were a
good many newly cut trenches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span></p>

<p>Some soldiers were rather friendly when I revealed
myself as a Netherland reporter; they informed
me with serious faces that in Germany two
million volunteers were drilling; that in each
garrison-town the majority of the men were left
behind as reserves; that by and by they were going
to level Antwerp to the ground, if these Belgians
would not keep quiet; that after all Belgium
proved a bigger job than they had bargained for;
that Amsterdam and Rotterdam had been shelled
and Flushing taken by the British; that Germany
had now sent a great number of troops into The
Netherlands to protect her against Britain, because
The Netherlands herself had no army at all; and
so on and so on.</p>

<p>One of the soldiers took me to the spot where two
days before the Belgians had blown up the railway
which had just now been repaired by the German
engineers. According to his story eighty troopers
had succeeded in surprising a guard of twelve and in
pushing on to the railway.</p>

<p>Near Corbeek-Loo a strong Belgian force had
been able even to reach the main road to Louvain,
and there also destroyed the railway, after which
they retreated before the advancing Germans.</p>

<p>These minor actions formed part of the sortie by
the Belgians from Antwerp. One division marched
towards Louvain and occupied Aerschot on Thursday
evening, September 10th. On Friday they advanced
farther in the direction of Wijgmaal-Rotselair-Corbeek-Loo,
with continuous hard fighting.
On Saturday the fights were fiercest round about
these places, and ended in the evening in a retreat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
of the Belgians, who made the enemy pay as heavily
as possible for their victory, although they themselves
had to leave behind a good many victims.</p>

<p>Considerations of space forbid me to relate many
of the heroic deeds performed on this occasion, but
an exception may be made of the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>When I arrived in Louvain I heard of a young
Fleming who was then being nursed in a hospital
established by the Norbertine Fathers, and had been
serving at two pieces of ordnance near Corbeek-Loo.
As the army was forced to retreat in the
evening his comrades were compelled to abandon
the two guns, but he had to stay, being wounded in
the leg by a grape shot. The Germans made him
prisoner, and tied him to a tree. By an immense
effort he succeeded in tearing himself loose, and
dragged himself towards a farm-house. At a short
distance from this goal he was stopped, however,
by a German soldier. The Fleming, putting forth
all his remaining strength, gave the other such a
tremendous blow in the face with his rifle-butt that
he fell down dead. Subsequently this boy reached
the farm-house, where he was charitably received.
Later on he was fetched away by the Sisters from
Boven-Loo, and finally from that institution by
the Norbertine Fathers.</p>

<p>The Belgians left also a considerable number of
dead and wounded at Wijgmaal and Rotselair. On
Tuesday, September 15th, I visited the battle-fields
in that neighbourhood with father Coppens, a
Netherland Norbertine, born at Lieshout. The
wounds of the soldiers lying there were in a most
terrible condition, because <i>the Germans forbade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
the removal of the Belgian wounded before all the
German dead had been buried</i>. In my opinion not
only a proof of barbarity, but also an admission that
the Germans themselves must have suffered great
losses.</p>

<p>The Wijgmaal battle-field was after all the least
horrible. About ten houses seemed to have been
set on fire on purpose; the rest had suffered badly
from the bombardment. All the inhabitants had
fled as soon as the fighting began. The wounded
Belgians had been placed in the large dancing-room
of a café, where father Coppens brought them a
large hamper full of eatables and drinkables, and
whence also he had them transported to Louvain.
The food was gratefully accepted, but they were
still more eager to get hold of the mugs, as they were
very thirsty in consequence of the high temperature
caused by the inflamed wounds; often we had to
prevent them forcibly from drinking too much.</p>

<p>We passed a dead field-officer who still laid hold
of a piece of a flag. When I read that sort of thing
in a book, I thought: "how pretty and romantic,"
but never believed that this would actually happen
in war-time. I saw the reality now, and, deeply
touched, bared my head, saluting that dead hero.
From papers we found on him we saw that his name
was Van Gesthel; like most Belgians, he had been
killed by shell.</p>

<p>I went on with Father Coppens and found about
one hundred wounded, of whom only a few had been
taken to the houses. Most of them crept away
frightened, but when we told them that we were
Netherlanders from Louvain, who came to bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
them food and drink, and to take them away to be
nursed, they got hold of our coats and refused to let
us go.</p>

<p>They drank deep, in long draughts, with trembling
lips, and beseeched us not to leave them again:
"Oh, gentlemen, then we shall die!" We swore
that we should come back, and that later on carriages
would arrive from Louvain to take them to some
convent or hospital; and, trusting us, they resigned
themselves in the end.</p>

<p>Goats, pigs, cows, and other cattle roamed freely
through the village-street, looking for food and
licking the faces of the dead.</p>

<p>We entered a stable whence we thought that a
sound came. We saw, however, nothing but a heap
of straw, and a pig which ran up against us near the
door. Father Coppens chased it away with a:</p>

<p>"Get you gone, you brute!"</p>

<p>And all at once the straw began to move, a head
popped out, and a weak voice exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Ah well, be you a Fleming?"</p>

<p>The poor fellow had hidden himself, being afraid
that we were Germans; but when he heard the
"Get you gone, you brute!" he ventured to
show himself.</p>

<p>"Certainly, my lad," said Father Coppens&mdash;"certainly
we are Flemings. What is the matter
with you?"</p>

<p>We removed the rest of the straw, undressed him
partially, and on both his legs the most hideous
wounds became visible. Septic process had
worsened his condition to such an extent, that the
unfortunate boy had only a short time to live. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
moved away ... he confessed to Father Coppens,
who gave him the viaticum, which he carried with
him.</p>

<p>Later on people from Louvain came with carts,
which we had ordered before leaving. Thirteen
of these carried the wounded away, whilst a German
patrol went all over the village, setting everything
on fire.</p>

<p>Father Coppens and I beseeched the German
commanding officer to spare the houses of some
people, large families, who came for shelter to the
father's convent. And at length, after long
supplications, we secured exemption for a few houses,
inhabited by people who could not have done
anything in a village which had been completely
evacuated by the population, at the beginning of
the fight.</p>

<p>In the Hospital Leo XIII, that eager Netherlander,
Professor Noyons, did all he could to save
as many as could be saved of the wretched Belgian
wounded; but as rain and cold had done so much
harm to the wounds, amputation of the injured
limbs was as a rule the only remedy left.</p>

<p>Never thinking of rest he went on day and night,
taking away the poor fellows' arms and legs, and all
this by the miserable light of some candles. Gas
and electricity were not to be had, the works being
idle after the destruction of the town....</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />

ROUND ABOUT BILSEN</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> at first I had a different plan, I decided
on Saturday, September 26th, to go first to Riempst&mdash;a
little walk of three hours each way&mdash;as I had read
a report in certain papers quoted from the <i>Handelsblad
van Antwerpen</i> that the church of Riempst
had been burned and the vicars of that parish and
of Sichem had been made prisoners.</p>

<p>Arrived at Riempst I found the pretty village
church in its full glory and the vicar engaged in performing
his religious functions; the vicar of Sichem
was also still at home. The only part of the report
that was true was that various burgomasters from
the environs had been sent to Tongres and had not
returned since. The burgomaster of Riempst, with
whom I had been imprisoned already once, was being
searched for by the Germans everywhere, but could
not be found. In several places I heard also that
the Belgians were lying in the woods round about,
and that something was being prepared at Riempst;
but no one knew what. So I decided to go and
inquire.</p>

<p>The road was quite deserted, for the people, who
live in great fear, do not venture out.</p>

<p>As far as Bilsen everything seemed equally deserted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
but quite near the town a couple of German soldiers
suddenly came to me from behind a house, and
ordered me to stop. They took me with them to the
guard, which was established in the aforementioned
house.</p>

<p>There it appeared that my papers were in good
order, but at the same time I was informed that I
was to be taken to the commanding officer at the
station and could not be allowed to leave Bilsen
for the present. I was escorted through the townlet,
which appeared to be entirely deserted; but
now and then somebody came to his front-door to
watch the latest victim of the Germans being led
past. At the station I was pushed without much
courtesy into a keep where six other civilians sat,
who had been picked up as being at large, and whose
faces were now covered with a cold perspiration
from fear, because they were firmly convinced that
by and by they would be shot.</p>

<p>Three soldiers stood before the open door and
amused themselves by provoking these people in
the most inhuman manner, by abusing them and
telling them that later on they would be hanged or
shot. The poor fellows shivered and their teeth
clattered. I, the newly arrived "swine," was treated
in much the same way, but I reduced the insolent
blusterers into the quietest people of the world by
warning them that by and by I would ask the
commanding officer whether his soldiers had the
right to call a Netherlander a "swine." That put
some heart into my fellow-victims, and I urged them
that they would do best by replying calmly to any
questions which the commanding officer might put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
to them. They actually became more composed,
and told me the following:</p>

<p>The Germans had evacuated Bilsen some days
ago, probably after being informed that a strong
force of Belgians was coming on. As a matter of fact,
only eleven Belgian soldiers had entered the townlet.
These had pulled down the German flag from
the town-hall and replaced it by the Belgian. The
station and the railway were then closed to the
public for a couple of hours, and in that time they
pulled up the rails in two places. On Friday evening
the Germans returned in great numbers by train
from Tongres, and the train derailed on one of
those places; but no lives were lost, as it went very
slowly.</p>

<p>The Germans had then taken it into their heads
that the Belgians occupied Bilsen and the station,
and began a terrific fire at the station and the
surrounding houses, although there was not a single
Belgian soldier in the whole town. When they
had satisfied themselves that this was the case,
they stopped firing, and were furious on account
of the derailing and the mistake they had made.
They then started a wild hunt for the men, and set
about ten houses on fire, as also the signalman's
cottage, because he had not warned them of the
danger by waving his red flag.</p>

<p>They made no allowance for the fact that they
themselves had relieved all railway officials of their
functions until later notification. The signalman
was made a prisoner, but released subsequently.</p>

<p>As soon as they began to chase the men, the greater
part of the inhabitants fled in dire fear, most of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
them towards the Campine. In the fields and the
shrubberies the Germans must have killed a good
many of the male fugitives, and made the others
prisoners. Among the latter were my six fellow-victims.</p>

<p>That same Friday evening the women and children
living in the Rue de la Station were told to
leave their houses as the whole street was to be
burned down. Everybody fled, but the design
was not executed. The burgomaster and his son
were taken prisoners, and brought to Tongres;
later on the son was released; the Very Reverend
the Dean was also arrested.</p>

<p>The latter himself told me that he was released
in order to instruct the vicars in the eighteen
parishes of his deanery that they should inform
their parishioners that the whole village would be
burned and the inhabitants killed if the railway-line
should be broken up, no matter whether it
were done by Belgian soldiers or others.</p>

<p>After I had been incarcerated for about two
hours I was taken to the commanding officer, Major
Krittel, or rather to one of his subordinates, Captain
Spuer, who was having a violent altercation with
his chief. The captain appeared to insist with
great force that the whole place should be burned
down and all the prisoners shot. But the major
seemed to be a tolerably reasonable man, tried to
soothe the captain, and at last put down his foot,
saying that he had had enough. The captain, a
rude, fat fellow, sat down at a desk and bellowed
at me:</p>

<p>"Here, swine!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span></p>

<p>I did not budge.</p>

<p>"Here, swine!"</p>

<p>"I am a Netherlander."</p>

<p>"Netherlander? Doesn't matter. Have you
got papers? All right. You shan't have those
back."</p>

<p>"Then I'll lodge a complaint with the Imperial
Governor of Liège, who gave me the papers."</p>

<p>"Swine!"</p>

<p>Now the major jumped up and shouted at his
subordinate that he had to treat a Netherlander
as he ought to be treated.</p>

<p>The major, sitting at another desk, took my
further examination upon himself, apologising for
the "noisy" conduct of his subordinate, who had
got somewhat over-excited in consequence of the
circumstances. He found my papers in perfect
order, and told me in civil tones that I should get
back my liberty which I had lost in consequence
of a misunderstanding, but that for the present I
was not allowed to leave Bilsen, as I should run
the greatest risk of being shot by German or Belgian
patrols, who were hidden along the road. He
asked me to call again the next morning.</p>

<p>I availed myself of his benevolent mood and told
him that my fellow-prisoners were treated very
unkindly by his soldiers, and these people had lost
their composure entirely in consequence. A calm
examination, I told him, undoubtedly would give
him also the conviction that these people had only
fled into the fields because they were afraid, but
not with any criminal intent. He promised me
to conduct the examination himself, and to be as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
kind as possible. The next morning I heard that
they had all been released.</p>

<p>I now tried to get something to eat in the town
at an hotel.</p>

<p>"Well, what have you got for me to eat?"</p>

<p>"To eat, sir&mdash;to eat? A bit of bacon ... that's
all."</p>

<p>"Well, that's all right; and what am I going to
have with it, bread, potatoes, or...."</p>

<p>"Bread, potatoes? Nothing. We have nothing."</p>

<p>I went to various other places, but there I could
not even get a bit of bacon. So I made up my
mind to starve for the present, and to make inquiries
here and there about families whose acquaintances
or friends had asked me to do so through the editor
of <i>De Tijd</i>.</p>

<p>Afterwards I sauntered through the very quiet
little town, until I suddenly saw something quite
uncommon, namely two civilians who, like myself,
were walking about. When I came near, one of
them recited a rhyme:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"Ah, there comes Mister Tijd, and he</div>
<div class="i0">Lost like ourselves his liberty!"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>I had not the faintest idea who they were, but
then they introduced themselves as van Wersch
and Dasoul, both living at the time at Hasselt. The
first had been at Maastricht a couple of days ago
and had seen me there. He told me that that
morning he had been "hooked" and his companion
only the evening before. He had come to Bilsen
on a bicycle, and got such a blow on his back from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
the butt of a German rifle that the butt was cracked
in two although his back was not injured.</p>

<p>He had been uneasy because he experienced no
disagreeable consequences of that blow, and had
therefore consulted the doctor at Bilsen, who
thought that only his excited nerves had enabled
him to withstand such a blow. Both had been
locked up a couple of hours and their bicycles had
been taken away, as also their papers. Mr. van
Wersch, however, had an acquaintance at Bilsen
with whom he and his companion found lodgings,
and whither he was good enough to take me as well.</p>

<p>After a bed had been promised me, my first
request was for something to eat, for I had not
enjoyed anything as yet. But there was nothing
left, absolutely nothing. I scratched my head,
and rubbed my empty stomach, when suddenly I
heard a fowl cackling outside. Negotiations about
it were soon finished; my companion was to kill
the fowl, whereas I was to call on Major Krittel
and tell him that I liked my enforced stay in Bilsen
very much, but that he ought to see now that I
got something to eat.</p>

<p>I returned with two large round "brown
Georges"&mdash;soldiers' loaves.</p>

<p>Never did I enjoy a meal so much; but not so
the kind people who had received us so friendly;
they could not eat. The terror which reigned
among the population in those days was indescribable.
One must have seen it and gone through
it with them, to realise it. They really feared that
at any moment the Germans would drive the population
out of the houses and set the town on fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span></p>

<p>Men and women in the prime of life sat on their
chairs, gazing vacantly at nothing, lacking in the
most literal sense of the word the strength to
stand or to walk. When at about six o'clock in the
evening the click-clack of rifle-fire was heard&mdash;for
a Belgian patrol seemed to have come near the town,&mdash;my
hostess and her daughter pressed a couple of
papers against their breast, full of fear, ready to fly,
but unable to walk.</p>

<p>That same afternoon also I made the acquaintance
of the editor of a local weekly, <i>De Bilsenaar</i>, which
was not allowed to appear during the occupation
of the place by the Germans. He and others had
a great many things to tell me.</p>

<p>Not half of the requisitioned meat was used by
the Germans, and the rest was simply left to rot,
whilst the starving people were not allowed to
touch it. Two pigs and a cow were shot in a
meadow, but no part of these animals had been
used, the order to bury them being given when the
smell became unendurable. In some places the
Germans indulged in such unspeakably filthy acts,
that it is impossible to mention details.</p>

<p>When the Germans entered Bilsen for the first
time, four persons were shot in front of the town-hall;
fifteen holes were still to be seen in the wall.
Amongst these four was also the brother-in-law
of the editor of the <i>Bilsenaar</i>. He was dragged
out of his house, accused of having shot, although
he and his wife and children were at that moment
saying the rosary. His wife had got up that day
for the first time after her confinement.</p>

<p>The unhappy man asserted in a loud voice that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
he was innocent, but got the answer that he would
have to prove that later on. But he never had
a chance of doing that. Arriving at the market-place,
he and three others were simply placed against
the wall and shot. He could not even have spiritual
assistance.</p>

<p>Frequently Protestant services were held in the
market-place, conducted by a parson, and the invariable
beginning and end of that parson's allocution
was: "There is one God; there must also
be one Kaiser."</p>

<p>A good many lads had been able to escape from
Bilsen and the environs to Antwerp; in the aggregate,
500 from this district, and more went every
day. They were driven to the Belgian army by
all they had seen and experienced. Often one
heard women and girls say: "Oh, if I were a
man, if I were a boy, I should be in the army
to-morrow!"</p>

<p>I was sitting comfortably in the home circle of the
editor of <i>De Bilsenaar</i>, with father, mother, and
daughter. They had one son of eighteen, who
was at the Junior Seminary at Hasselt, and only the
first Sunday in August he had left for Heerenth in
order to offer himself as a missionary aspirant. The
next Wednesday the would-be missionary, an only
son, enlisted as a volunteer in the Belgian army....
He was already the sixteenth of his form of
twenty-three boys at the college at Hasselt.</p>

<p>The father got up and went to a small cupboard
from which he took some papers, and his eyes, and
those of his wife and daughter, became moist at
once; letters from their only boy, written on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
battle-field! He read them out with a broken voice,
frequently interrupted by sobs. I said nothing,
could not utter a word.</p>

<p>The boy also had been obliged to retire into
France, had been transported from Rheims to
Havre, and from there, across the sea, back to Belgium.
"Five times already, my dear parents, I have
been in the fight; I have asked them not to let me
wait long for the sixth. Oh, you cannot imagine
how glorious it is to be allowed to fight for my
country! Have confidence in the future, dear
parents, and say a paternoster for me and my comrades
and also one for our Fatherland."</p>

<p>Well, I could not keep calm when I heard such
things read by a father from a letter of his only son
on the battle-field; that is impossible.</p>

<p>The next morning was Sunday, and the bells
summoned the people to church. But nobody
went, nobody dared to appear in the street, although
prayer-book and rosary are always in everybody's
hands during these days. I had decided to go to
the second Mass, but as nobody had come to the first,
there was no second. The Dean himself said that
the people were quite right not to come to church.
The previous Sunday the Germans, who had
entered Lanaeken suddenly, had posted themselves
in front of the church, where the believers attended
Holy Mass, and ordered the women and children to
leave the church, but the men to stay. When all
the women and children had left, the Germans
entered the building and ... found not a single
man, for all had left quickly by the back door. A
veritable battue was held in the whole district for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
lads and young men, who were all taken away as
prisoners by the Germans, because during the last
few days great numbers had escaped to the north
and enlisted as volunteers in the army.</p>

<p>I went to the commander's office, and on the way
copied the following Proclamation:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">"PROCLAMATION</p>

<p>"Private motor-cars, motor-bicycles, and bicycles are only
allowed to move about in the districts occupied by the German
army if driven by German soldiers, or the chauffeur possesses
a licence. These licences are only issued by the local commanders,
and only in urgent cases. The motor-cars, motor-bicycles,
and bicycles will be seized if this rule is infringed.
Anyone who tries to push through the German outposts shall
be shot at, as also anyone who approaches them in such a
manner that he seems to be a spy.</p>

<p>"Should telegraph- or telephone-wires be cut in the neighbourhood
of towns and villages, these places will be sentenced
to pay a war-contribution, whether the inhabitants are guilty
or not.</p>

<p class="right">
"The Governor-General of Belgium.<br />
<span class="smcap">Baron Von der Goltz</span>,<br />
<i>Field-Marshal</i>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>At the station Major Krittel was engaged in
examining a civilian and his wife. The man had
been found in a field; both shook from nervous
excitement and wept profusely. The major spoke
calmly and encouragingly, and after a short examination
both got their liberty. Major Krittel was
also very kind to me again, but asked emphatically
whether I knew that writing false news exposed me
to the danger of capital punishment. I answered
that I was firmly convinced of that. He then gave
me another proclamation to read in which this was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
mentioned, and I asked and got permission to put the
document in my pocket. It runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">
"<span class="smcap">Tongres.</span><br />
"24.9.1914,
</p>

<p class="center">"PROCLAMATION</p>

<p>"Several cases which occurred in the Province of Limburg
oblige me to acquaint the inhabitants of a number of regulations:</p>

<p>"According to Clause 58, Section 1, of the Military Penal
Code, sentence of capital punishment for treason will be
pronounced against those who, intending to assist an enemy
army, or to injure the German army:</p>

<ul><li>"1. Commit a punishable offence mentioned in Clause 90
of the German Penal Code.</li>

<li>"2. Injure or make useless roads or telegraphic instruments.</li>

<li>"3. Serve the enemy as guides in a military undertaking
against the German allied forces, or mislead the latter when
serving them as guides.</li>

<li>"4. Who in whatever way in order to harass or mislead
the German forces make military or other signals, urge to
flee, or prevent the reunion of straggling soldiers.</li>

<li>"5. Who undertake to enter into verbal or written communication
with persons in the army or the fleet, of the
enemy country at war with Germany, about matters relating
to the war itself.</li>

<li>"6. Who distribute in the German army hostile incitements
or communications.</li>

<li>"7. Who neglect necessary precautions which ought to be
taken on behalf of the army.</li>

<li>"8. Liberate prisoners of war.</li></ul>

<p>"According to Clause 90 of the German Penal Code,
sentence of penal servitude for life will be pronounced against
those:</p>

Belgium not occupied by German forces. It is forbidden
to take communications of whatever kind from these parts
of Belgium and those that are occupied by the German army.
These offences will be punished with imprisonment. Serious

will be followed by sentence of death.</p>

<p class="right">
"<span class="smcap">Sterzel</span>,<br />
<i>Major and Commanding Officer</i>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>I had also to promise the major that on my
return I should bring with me a copy of <i>De Tijd</i>
in which all I had experienced and seen in Bilsen
was described, and also a box of Netherland cigars,
which he promised to pay for; then I was allowed
to go.</p>

<p>As I went a patrol marched out&mdash;reinforcements
had again come from Tongres&mdash;whose task was to
clear the district of the enemy. The patrol consisted
of six Death-head hussars, about forty bicyclists,
and the rest infantry, altogether about four hundred
men, who were able to keep together, because the
hussars and the cyclists proceeded very slowly and
cautiously in the direction of Lanaeken. I went
with them, chatting with one of the officers. As
soon as they had got to the road, the greatest caution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
was observed. The hussars went in front, followed
by some of the infantry, all in loose formation,
continually looking about in all directions, with the
finger at the cock of the rifle.</p>

<p>Not a single person was seen on the road, and
everything went well until we got to the village
of Veldwezelt. Suddenly, quite unexpectedly, a
violent rifle fire and a continued whistling of bullets
was heard from the neighbourhood of a house close
by. Although the soldiers later on asserted to the
contrary, I was sure that the firing did not come
from the house, but from some underwood near by.</p>

<p>After some firing one of the hussars was hit and
fell from his horse, which ran away. A few seconds
later another hussar was hit in his arm and his horse
in its hind-part. Rider and horse flew away from
the fire. The Germans had, of course, immediately
answered the firing, and pulled me with them
behind the bend of the road, where I lay down with
them flat on the ground. A Belgian soldier who
came out of the shrubbery with three others was
shot, but as the firing went on for some time and the
hussars and cyclists began to take to their heels,
some order was given, and the Germans jumped up
and ran away in the direction of Bilsen. I was told
to come with them, so I also ran, and we all arrived
at Bilsen out of breath. As soon as they had
recovered their breath they gave vent to their rage.</p>

<p>They yelled and shouted and said that Bilsen
and the whole district must be burned down, that
the major was far too kind, that they were cowardly
soldiers who hid themselves in houses and dared
not fight an honest fight in the open, that civilians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
had also been shooting, and so on. I pointed out
that the firing did not come from the house, but from
the shrubbery near the house; that nobody could
have seen a civilian shooting. As they insisted, I said
with a laugh that they had seen ghosts. That
excited them so, that they came on to me in a rage,
and asked whether this was a laughing matter?
And they would surely have used violence had not
the sergeant intervened.</p>

<p>I went immediately to the major to give him a
detailed report of the occurrence, and I believe
that I may say without boasting that owing to my
intervention Veldwezelt was not burned down,
although other frightful things happened there.</p>

<p>The hussar who was first hit, died later on. The
other appeared to be only slightly wounded in
the arm.</p>

<p>Of course I had to remain at Bilsen after this
adventure. The major appeased his men somewhat,
mounted a ridiculously small horse, and marched out
at the head of his men. Two hundred men who had
just arrived from Tongres were added as reinforcements
to the major's troops, who had now about
six hundred men with him. Thus they went again
to Veldwezelt, but the few Belgians, who were no
fools, had left of course.</p>

<p>Towards evening the major returned with his
men, who in loud voices sounded forth all sorts of
patriotic songs, elated because they had driven
away the enemy. As he entered I addressed the
major, who with a grand sweep of his arm called out
to me: "You may go now; I have cleared the
whole district."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span></p>

<p>I was very curious to know what had happened
in Veldwezelt. When I came near the village, I
noticed great activity; men, women, and children
were busy with saws and hatchets cutting down all
the trees and shrubs along the road.</p>

<p>Beautiful hedges, which had been grown artificially
in fine forms for years, fell under the blows
of the hatchets. The reason? Before the day was
over all hedges, all shrubs, and all trees had to be
cut down, or the village would be set on fire. Still
shaking and trembling in consequence of the terrors
they had experienced during the day, old men,
women, and children with red flushed cheeks joined
in the work; they had not even taken time to change
their Sunday- for their working-day clothes.</p>

<p>And if that had been all! But dozens of boys and
young men had been taken to Bilsen as prisoners.
There had been a real hunt for all able-bodied lads
who might be of any use in the Belgian army.
Women and old men were compelled by threats
to betray the hiding-places of their sons or husbands,
and if one of them was found hidden away under
straw or in barns, he was ill-treated or beaten with
rifle-butts. Some fled to Maastricht, others to
the Campine, the northern part of Belgium. I
presume that both groups have at length arrived in
Antwerp.</p>

<p>Dr. Beckers, Government veterinary surgeon at
Veldwezelt, had also been taken to Bilsen as a
hostage. The Germans asserted that the Belgians
in Lanaeken had taken prisoner a German military
veterinary surgeon who looked after the horses, and
now intended to keep Dr. Beckers until the Belgians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
should have released the German military veterinary
surgeon.</p>

<p>During the occupation a war contribution of
150,000 francs in silver had been imposed on Bilsen,
although there was hardly any silver left in the place.
This punishment was inflicted because Belgian
soldiers had destroyed the railway in two places.</p>

<p>Near Lanaeken I met suddenly a Belgian soldier,
who did not trouble me after I had shown him my
papers. I was quite astonished to find that man
there all by himself, whilst so many Germans were
only a few miles away. When I asked whether he
knew this, he answered:</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Are you not afraid?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"But when the Germans come!"</p>

<p>"Then I shall shoot."</p>

<p>"But that will mean death for yourself."</p>

<p>"What does that matter? What do I care for
life? I come from Dinant; they have murdered
my dear parents, burned our house. What good
is it to me to be alive? I requested them to give
me this dangerous outpost. When the Germans
come, I'll shoot, and then my comrades at Lanaeken
will be warned. Then I'll kill three or four of
them, but after that I shall be ready to die myself."</p>

<p>The man looked at me with glittering eyes full
of the passion of revenge. I pressed his hand and
went on.</p>

<p>Lanaeken seemed to have been reoccupied by
the Belgians, after the occurrences of the previous
Sunday. When I entered the place, I found the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
greater number of the men round about the
station.</p>

<p>The Belgians who had fired at the Germans near
Veldwezelt had also come back there. They were
eleven motor-cyclists who had been reconnoitring;
when near Veldwezelt they saw the Germans
approach and hid themselves in the shrubberies,
intending to attack them. The only wounded
person they had was only slightly hurt, and within
a few days he would be able to rejoin his comrades.</p>

<p>Mr. van Wersch, whom I mentioned above, and
who shared imprisonment with me at Bilsen, had
a rather disagreeable adventure a few days afterwards,
when he had the misfortune of being mistaken
for the war-correspondent of <i>De Tijd</i>.</p>

<p>My letter to that paper about what had happened
in Bilsen seemed to have reached the German
authorities at that place, and these gentlemen
were not at all pleased with it. When Mr. van
Wersch came back to the place a few days afterwards
he was mistaken for myself, and arrested at
once.</p>

<p>After having been searched all over, he was escorted
by a sergeant and two soldiers to Tongres, where
they took him to Captain Spuer, the same fat officer
who, so kindly, had called me a "swine."</p>

<p>When they arrived at Tongres, the captain happened
to have returned to Bilsen, whither the
prisoner was brought back by the same escort.
But Captain Spuer seemed not to be found there
either, in consequence of which the major allowed
Mr. van Wersch at last to go on.</p>

<p>When he passed the village of Veldwezelt he met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
a motor-car ... in which was Captain Spuer.
He recognised his victim at once, and also mistook
him for the war correspondent of <i>De Tijd</i>. Mr.
van Wersch was immediately detained again, and
taken to a farm-house in the neighbourhood, where
he was threatened with a revolver, and roared at:
"You are the correspondent of <i>De Tijd</i>."</p>

<p>Mr. van Wersch denied this of course, but nevertheless
they took him to Bilsen in the motor-car.
There he was searched once more, the Netherland
letters he had with him were taken away, as also
1,800 francs. But when he was released they gave
him back the money.</p>

<p>Mr. van Wersch was told that they intended to
send him to Tongres, but after a deliberation between
Captain Spuer and Major Krittel, a very
kind man as I have already remarked, he was allowed
to stay at Bilsen until the examination should be
over. He was allowed to walk through the townlet
under military escort at first, but later entirely free,
and to sleep at the station under military guard.
After another search, he was at last allowed to leave
for Maastricht on Monday morning.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />

DURING THE SIEGE OF ANTWERP</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> days before the Germans marched upon
Antwerp I announced the siege in my paper. In
Louvain I had seen all the preparations and also
the arrival of the Austrian 30·5 c.m. which were
intended to batter to ruins the bulwark of the
national defence.</p>

<p>As soon as the siege had begun, I tried to join
the Germans, viâ Louvain, and left Maastricht
again by motor-car. Only a few miles from the
Netherland frontier I met the first soldiers, Belgians.
When they saw the Orange flag with the word
"Nederland," they let us pass without any trouble.
A little farther on the road walked a civilian, who,
by putting up his hands, requested or commanded
us to stop. We took the most prudent part, and
did stop. The man asked in bad Dutch to be
allowed to drive on with us to Brussels, but the
motor was not going beyond Tirlemont; outside
that place motor-traffic was forbidden. The
stranger got in all the same, in order to have a
convenient journey at least so far.</p>

<p>My new companion tried desperately to speak as
good Dutch as possible, but failed in the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
deplorable manner; every time pure German words
came in between. He told a story that he stayed
at Maastricht as a refugee, and now wanted to
fetch his children from a girls' boarding-school at
Brussels. I pretended to believe every word, and
after he had forgotten the first story he made up
another, saying that he came from Liège, where
some officers who were billeted on him were kind
enough to give him a chance of going to Brussels,
to purchase stock for his business.</p>

<p>When we were stopped by German outposts he
put out of the window a paper at which they just
glanced, stood to attention, and said that all was
well. They did not even want to see my papers.
In a casual way I asked what a miraculous sort of
paper he had, and then he pretended that, by the
help of those officers who were quartered on him,
he had got a certificate from the Governor of Liège
with the order to treat him with great respect and
also to allow him to travel by military trains if
the opportunity happened to offer itself.</p>

<p>In Tongres it was necessary to get a passport
signed, and pay three marks each, and ten marks
for the motor. But the office of the commander
was not open before three o'clock in the afternoon,
according to the soldiers who were doing sentry-go
in front of the town-hall. Wait till three o'clock?
No fear! My companion showed his miraculous
paper again, and was allowed to go in, but only
by himself. I gave him my papers and those of
the chauffeur, and also wanted to give him sixteen
marks, three each for the chauffeur and myself and
ten for the motor, but he said that that was un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>necessary.
Within twenty minutes the fellow came
back with our verified passports on which the words
"Paid: Free" were written.</p>

<p>A lot of artillery and a great number of soldiers
were in the market-place ready to start. The
commander sent one of his officers to us, who addressed
me, examined my papers, and then said
that I had surely met Belgian soldiers on the way.
Of course I denied this emphatically.</p>

<p>"Don't you know then whether there are Belgian
military in Vroenhoven?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"And in Lanaeken?"</p>

<p>"I know nothing about that."</p>

<p>"Didn't hear either about it?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Evidently he seemed to confide in me, and told
me that they had been ordered to clear the north-east
corner of Belgium of enemies, and that by and
by they were going to march upon Lanaeken first
of all.</p>

<p>When he was gone I gazed for some moments in
silence at all these men and guns, destined to go and
destroy by and by the heroes, who have done so
much harm to the Germans, under command of the
brave lieutenant Count de Caritat, burgomaster
of Lanaeken. I thought of that brave Belgian
from Dinant whom I met on his solitary outpost
outside Lanaeken, and if I had acted according to
my heart's desire, I should have sneaked away to
the threatened point in order to warn those
courageous men of the approaching disaster.</p>

<p>My mysterious companion touched my shoulder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
and asked whether we should not go on. "All
right," I said, and we got in again.</p>

<p>At Tirlemont they were very busy rebuilding the
burnt houses, although all day long the air shook
from the heavy roar of the cannon near Antwerp.</p>

<p>I sent the motor back to The Netherlands, and
went with my companion to the commander's office,
where we got a permit to go on by military train.</p>

<p>From the side of Brussels many soldiers arrived
at the station, who had all been wounded near
Antwerp.</p>

<p>After a long time we were able to enter a train
taking numerous new troops to Antwerp. We
occupied a first-class compartment, which looked
like a cattle-truck: pieces of bread, paper, cigar-ends,
and tobacco were lying on the floor and
the seats; the ledges of the windows were full of
candle-grease.</p>

<p>We jogged on to Louvain at a rate of not quite
three miles an hour. Here and there we had to
wait a half or a whole hour to let trains from Brussels
pass. The reason why the train went so slowly
was because a week before a Belgian patrol had
daringly broken through the outposts and destroyed
the railway near Lovenjool. That village was then
burned down completely and the vicar made a
prisoner.</p>

<p>Near Louvain the train had to stop for another
two hours, before it was allowed to enter the station,
which was quite close by. I thanked my stars that
at last I got rid of my companion, who travelled
on to Brussels, whereas I got out at Louvain. It
was too late to be allowed to walk in the streets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
but the commander gave me an escort of two soldiers,
who were to take me to the mission house of the
Fathers of the Sacred Heart.</p>

<p>It was very cold that evening, and the outposts
at Heverlee had all wrapped themselves up in
blankets. Once or twice we were stopped, but the
password of my escort removed all difficulties.</p>

<p>"Is it much farther?" one of my armed guides
asked.</p>

<p>"No, only a couple of minutes."</p>

<p>"I am thirsty. I should like very much to have
a glass of beer."</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied, "but everything is closed."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, but we shall like it also to-morrow,
hi, hi, hi!"</p>

<p>It is as if the curse of drink always pursued the
garrison in Louvain, for when and wherever I met
German soldiers in that town, or came into touch
with them, they were always drunk. That evening,
also, I was glad when I arrived at the mission house,
tipped the men, and got rid of them until the next
day.</p>

<p>The Fathers were already in bed, but I soon got
them out again. Within ten minutes I was enjoying
what, in the circumstances, was a splendid meal,
and the Fathers were absorbed in the daily and
illustrated papers which I had brought for them.</p>

<p>The conditions at Louvain were the same as some
weeks ago: hunger and misery. Some male
prisoners had come back, and also over 150 female
prisoners, who for more than a month had been
in captivity in the Munster Camp. During the
last days a real reign of terror ruled. Hostages were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
continually claimed, and nearly always they took
clerics. The week before the people had feared
a new destruction. It was said that there had
been shooting again, but happily the inquiry
showed that a German soldier did it, and he was
punished. The shot had been fired in front of
the Josephite convent.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A remarkable strike had taken place in the Leo
XIII Hospital. The head of this institution, Dr.
Tits, also had been taken as a hostage. It was
the most blackguardly act one can think of, to take
away the man who had spent night and day mostly
nursing wounded Germans. Dr. Noyons found
it so harsh that he took counsel with the other
doctors, and they decided not to resume work
before Dr. Tits came back. This of course happened
immediately.</p>

<p>The man who bears the full responsibility for
the destruction of Louvain, General von Manteuffel,
had left already when I visited the town this time,
and nobody has ever been able to find out what
became of him. The latest proclamations were
all signed: "By order of the General Government
of Brussels&mdash;the Etappe-Commander."</p>

<p>Louvain was of course on tenterhooks about the
course of the siege of Antwerp, but everybody was
quite confident that this fortress would withstand
a long, long time, although they saw quite well
that the German attack was very fierce, for the
tremendous roar of the cannon never ceased for a
moment.</p>

<p>A walking excursion of one day took me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
Brussels. I might have done it in a few hours less,
but I lost my way in the wood-paths near Brussels,
for at a certain moment I read on a finger-post,
"Brussels four miles"; and after walking for a
long time, and wondering whether I should ever
finish those four miles, I read suddenly: "Brussels&mdash;eight
miles!" That gave me such a shock that
once more I had nearly taken the wrong way.</p>

<p>I put all my hope on a car that loomed up in the
distance. It was assisting in the reprovisioning of
Brussels, and only for that reason had the carman
got permission to use it. I signalled to him, and
he stopped&mdash;a big lout of a man who evidently
had had a drop too much; he would not allow me
to ride on with him, because he preferred to remain
alone on his car than to help a spy. "I am a
Belgian, a Belgian, and not a traitor, not a traitor
of my country," he assured me, with a lot of beery
tears. In any case the man meant well, and probably
he had tried to drown his troubles in drink.</p>

<p>In other circumstances I should not have taken
so much trouble, but I was so tired that I gave the
man all my papers to make him see that I was a
Netherland journalist. But according to him that
didn't matter at all, because the Netherlanders were
quite as dirty as the Germans, for they had allowed
the enemies of Belgium to pass through their country,
and so on. In a torrent of words I told him that
there was not a word of truth in it, and that the
Belgian Government would surely lose no time
in declaring the same as soon as the country was
free again. At last I appealed to his heart by
relating all the Netherlanders had done for the Belgians.
This had the desired effect, and I was allowed to drive home with him.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
At every inn he felt thirsty, and made me feel
quite clearly that I had every reason to treat him.
And every time that we went back to our seats he
said again:</p>

<p>"Yes, but now you see if after all you are a spy,
you see, then, you see, I'll knock you down, you
see?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, but now listen; I have told you already
that...."</p>

<p>"But don't you see if you should, don't you see,
you see I am a patriot."</p>

<p>"Oh, but listen: my papers...."</p>

<p>"Yes, but you see they may be forged, you see.
They may shoot me, you see, but a traitor, you see,
no, then I would knock you down, you see...."</p>

<p>That happened each time that he started again,
and I was more tired by trying to convince this man
than if I had walked all the rest of the way to
Brussels. But after all I got there.</p>

<p>There was much more liveliness in the Belgian
capital than during my first visit; it was as if the
bombardment of Antwerp had wakened the people
out of their slumber, an apparent slumber only, for
no citizens were ever more faithful to the Belgian
cause than those of Brussels.</p>

<p>There was shouting enough in the streets and
on the boulevards; here hawkers tried to sell maps
of the Fortress of Antwerp; there women and girls
offered scarf-pins with the portrait of Burgomaster
Max. Everybody had such a pin, and I soon sported
one too, for only then did these lady-sellers leave
me alone.</p>

<p>The German proclamations in Brussels were
nearly as numerous as the Max pins. They showered
them during the last days on the town, the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
more insolent than the other. After reading those
things, a proclamation by Burgomaster Max affected
me beneficially, whenever I could find one amongst
the mass of other bills posted on the walls. Such a
document testified to a grand soul and a firm character,
which vindicated courageously the rights of
the oppressed people.</p>

<p>In the streets and in the cafés I saw a great many
marines who had taken part in the fights near Antwerp
and were sent to Brussels for a few days' rest.
It was remarkable that so many of them who had
only lately looked death in the face, thought that
they could not amuse themselves better than by
mixing with girls of the worst description. Although
I cannot, of course, always believe what soldiers,
fresh back from a fight, assert in their over-excited
condition, I assumed that I might conclude that
things went badly with the defence of Antwerp.</p>

<p>A trip from Brussels to the scene of the fight
convinced me still more. I passed some time with
the artillery which had already silenced Waelhem,
and was now used against the other defences. The
sight of such an action was less interesting than one
might think, as I could not get to the places where
the infantry were storming. Only the thunder of
all these guns overwhelmed and gave me an idea of
the terror that was created.</p>

<p>From Antwerp, which I could see clearly from
the positions of the artillery near Waelhem, high
columns of smoke rose up from the Belgian artillery,
which was harassing the German positions.</p>

<p>Here I also saw in action one of the 30·5 cm.
Austrian howitzers mentioned before. The clumsy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
monster was constantly being shunted on a rail
forward and backward, and at long intervals sent
a gigantic projectile to the threatened quarters.
The sound was terrific, and the pressure of the
air made people at a great distance tremble on the
ground. The Austrian artillerists were still
equipped as if they had to fight in a rough, mountainous
country; the soles of their shoes were all
over covered with hobnails.</p>

<p>The Red Cross Service was well arranged, the
wounded were transported regularly, a large number
of motor-cars being used.</p>

<p>All soldiers and officers took the siege of the great
fortress calmly, convinced that at the most it would
be able to hold out for very few days. Reliable
information soon gave me the same impression,
although I had wished it might have been quite
different. When I left the scene of the fight all the
forts from Waelhem to St. Cathérine-Waver had
been silenced and in the hands of the Germans,
who would soon attack the inner circle of forts.</p>

<p>In Brussels the people seemed to be of a different
opinion. German reports about successes obtained
were simply not believed, and people persisted in
their opinion that Antwerp would be invincible.
The more reports of victories the Germans posted
on the walls, the more excited people became, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
palmed off upon each other all sorts of victories of
the Allies.</p>

<p>At the Café Quatre Bras, near Tervueren, the
innkeeper told me that the Germans had asked the
Netherland Government for permission to place a
42 cm. on Netherland territory in order to be able
to shell Antwerp also from that side, but that the
Netherland Government had refused. I tried as
hard as possible to explain to the man that all stories
of such requests were mere gossip. When more and
more people entered the café I withdrew into a
corner. They were all very excited, and some of
them had drunk more than was good for them.
They related with violent gesticulations that the
Allies had surrounded Brussels and might be expected
to enter the town at any moment, that all
was over with the Germans, and so on. Shouts of
"Vive la Belgique!" and "Vive notre roi!"
sounded until suddenly I drew their attention.
They looked me up and down critically, and one
of them asked:</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"A Netherland journalist, who is trying to get
news for his paper."</p>

<p>"What, a Netherlander!&mdash;a Netherlander! All
traitors! You are helping the Germans, but we are
not afraid of either German or Netherlander."</p>

<p>They crowded threateningly round me, getting
more and more excited.</p>

<p>I saw that I must act, and jumped on a chair.</p>

<p>"What," I exclaimed, "you dare to say that the
Netherlanders act with the Germans? No, shall
I tell you something? The Germans have asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
the Netherland Government for permission to place
a 42 cm. gun on their territory to shell Antwerp
from that side, but the Netherland Government
have refused."</p>

<p>"Lies, gossip."</p>

<p>"Lies, gossip? Ask the proprietor."</p>

<p>"Yes, men, what the gentleman says is true."</p>

<p>The rest was lost to me, for the men crowded
round the innkeeper, who now aired his knowledge
about the occurrence and evidently spoke with true
conviction. At the end of the conversation they
took their tankards from the bar, and shouted and
cried: "Ah, well, if that is so, vive la Hollande!
vive la Belgique! vive notre roi!" Suddenly we
were the best of friends.</p>

<p>In Louvain people would not believe that
Antwerp was on the point of surrendering, and
persisted in the opinion that the fortress would
hold out much longer, and was in a better position
than ever before.</p>

<p>The German officers at the commander's office
were elated in consequence of the reports received,
and also told me that Antwerp would not be able
to hold out for more than two days. They also
tried to explain this to the people in the hall who
were waiting for their passports. I followed the
conversation, but not very closely, and one of the
officers explained on a map what he asserted.
Willy-nilly, because they had to get their passports,
the waiting people listened to him. Suddenly I heard
him say: "And after all we might have surrounded
Antwerp also on the north by crossing Netherland
territory, as we did when we invaded Belgium."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span></p>

<p>Those words gave me a shock, for I had heard
that German officers always tried to encourage the
Belgians in their wrong opinion about the alleged
violation of Netherland neutrality, but I had not
been able to believe it. With an innocent face I
asked the officer:</p>

<p>"Where did the Germans cross Netherland
territory?"</p>

<p>"Near Maastricht. You know where Maastricht
is?"</p>

<p>And he summoned me to look at the map, where
he pointed out to me where Maastricht was.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" I said, "but in those days I was in
and about Maastricht, but I never noticed anything
of it."</p>

<p>"And yet it is so. Are you perhaps a Netherlander?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I am a Netherland journalist."</p>

<p>"Is that so? I beg your pardon, but won't you
come with me? I suppose that you want a passport.
I will take you to the commander."</p>

<p>He was quite upset, and evidently thought that
the best plan was to muzzle me by taking me away
from the others as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>I asked and got the commander's permission to
travel to Liège by military train, and from there to
The Netherlands, not only for myself, but also for
a Netherland girl of nine years, whose parents in
Amsterdam had repeatedly and persistently asked
me to see whether there would be any possibility
of letting their little girl come back from a Louvain
boarding-school. The Sisters with whom she was
let her go with me when I showed them a letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
from her father. That child had already seen a
good deal! The Sisters had fled with all the children
at the time of the conflagration, and hidden themselves
for days in a farm in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>During the last days hundreds of lads had left
Louvain for The Netherlands, and the migration
went on throughout the whole occupied part of
Belgium. It was the exodus of the levies of 1914
and 1915, who had been called up, and many of
whom had been sent to Germany as prisoners. The
Germans themselves had not a little furthered the
flight of these crowds; by proclamations they had
warned the lads not to try to escape, for otherwise
all of the levies of '14 and '15 would be taken
prisoners, and the parents of the fugitives would
be punished. At Heverlee and Louvain the lads
of both levies had to present themselves every
Friday at this station. The consequence was that
the following Friday not one single boy of those
levies was to be found in either place.</p>

<p>No more wounded were taken to the hospitals of
Louvain, as it had been decided to send them
straight on to Germany for the present; yet there
were many wounded men who were being nursed
there already, and the doctors had their hands full
attending to the wounded who passed the town.
Dr. Noyons told me that the previous Sunday a
train with 600 wounded had arrived from Northern
France, and he and his assistants had been requested
"just" to dress the wounds again of some of them.
The condition of these unfortunate men must have
been awful; not one had a dressing less than eight
days old. Most of them had had it on much longer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
and then these were merely emergency dressings.
They were laid on straw in cattle trucks, many of
them even in filth, and infection had worsened their
condition to a great extent. Dr. Noyons and his
colleagues tried to give the poor fellows as much relief
as possible, but as a matter of course they could
not do very much during a short stay at a station.</p>

<p>The general condition of the town was not calmer
during these last days. New hostages were taken
continually, and generally, as before, they were
clerics, in consequence of which the religious services
were in a continual muddle, and sometimes on
Sundays no Holy Mass could be said. Burgomaster
Nerinx had now posted proclamations in which he
called for volunteers to serve as temporary hostages,
instead of the priests, during the hours of religious
service. As if it were office work they mentioned:
"The service begins in the afternoon at ... o'clock
and will end after ... days at ... o'clock."</p>

<p>It was self-evident that very few were keen to
offer themselves as temporary substitutes for the
clerics.</p>

<p>I have, happily, not seen much of the distressing
flight of the Antwerp population, as I happened
to be at Liège when the fortress fell into German
hands. I went to Zundert viâ Maastricht and
Breda, in order to go to the conquered fortress
from that Netherland frontier-town, north-east of
Antwerp.</p>

<p>A good many refugees were on their way to The
Netherlands, but the bulk of the crowd had passed
before my visit along the long road which I walked
now in the opposite direction. I did not arrive in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
Antwerp before nightfall and was then very tired.
The town was dark, dismal, and deserted, and only
German soldiers went about in the streets, apparently
looking in vain for a shop or café where they
might find some diversion. I myself, exhausted by
a walk of twenty-five miles, sauntered along, constantly
looking for some place or other to pass the
night. Not a shop or hotel was open, and yet my
stomach was craving for food, my body for rest.
At last I met a policeman and told him of my
difficulty.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," he answered, "that will be difficult
enough. Everybody has fled, even my own wife
and children. I remained because I thought
it was my duty, and now I have been tramping
through the streets already for over twenty-four
hours, without being relieved. It seems that by
far the greater number of my colleagues fled also."</p>

<p>"Don't you think you could find me some hotel,
or private people who might put me up?"</p>

<p>"I am very much afraid I shan't be able, but
come along, and we'll try together."</p>

<p>So we went from street to street, without any
result. He rang the bell at many houses where he
knew that acquaintances lived, but always in vain,
and at last the kind man had to give it up.</p>

<p>I went on by myself, and arrived at last in a street
where I noticed a light in a house. When I came
near, I stood opposite a small café, with "Lodgings"
over the door. I was hardly able to go on, and did
not care whether it was "lodgings" or "hotel,"
if I could only get in somewhere.</p>

<p>But I did not stop long, for after a good look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
round it seemed the best to try and get away as
quickly as possible, and in that I succeeded. One
understands, however, that it was a terrific disappointment
for a man so tired to leave again after
thinking that he had at last found a place for
rest. At length I found an hotel near the Central
Station.</p>

<p>Antwerp had suffered from the horror of war.
The bombardment had destroyed many beautiful
quarters almost entirely, and even damaged badly
a number of hospitals. Of course the loss of many
lives had to be deplored.</p>

<p>The next day I had the pleasure of an interview
with Cardinal Mercier, whose residence in Antwerp
I had been able to find out at last. A wealthy lady
had offered his Eminence her grand house. In one
of the rooms I waited for the arrival of the cardinal,
the Metropolitan of the Belgian Church Provinces,
who, both as a prelate and a patriot, had been
tried so sorely in this war, which ravaged both his
university town and his episcopal town. Although
he was exceedingly busy, his Eminence had the kindness
to grant me an audience.</p>

<p>As I was still musing about the tragedy of this
venerable personality in these hard days of war, the
door was opened suddenly and his spare figure stood
before me. It was a moment full of emotion, and
perhaps I might not have recovered myself so
quickly if the kind prelate had not met me with
so much kindness.</p>

<p>After his Eminence had allowed me to kiss his
ring, he asked me to sit down. I had now a good
opportunity to notice how grief dwelt on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
entirely spiritualised face, in its frame of white
hair. But his extraordinary kindness in intercourse
did not leave him for one moment.</p>

<p>In connection with the summons, which had
been sent in the name of the archdiocese to <i>De
Tijd</i>, and had been proclaimed in all the churches
of Antwerp in the morning, his Eminence insisted
that it should be printed in its entirety, as very
many priests had taken refuge in The Netherlands,
whose help was pressingly wanted in the arch-diocese
in many of the parishes.</p>

<p>And he went on to say that he desired especially,
most fervently the return of the fled population.</p>

<p>"Really, in all sincerity," he said, "no danger
need be feared. I should be very grateful if the
newspapers in The Netherlands would draw attention
to the following promises which the German
authorities gave me, and authorised me to make
in their name:&mdash;</p>

<ul><li>"1. The young men need not fear that they will
be taken to Germany in order to serve in the German
army, or be compelled to do any work.</li>

<li>"2. Should the police regulations be infringed
anywhere by some individuals, the authorities will
find the guilty parties and punish them, without
attributing the guilt to the entire population.</li>

<li>"3. The German and Belgian authorities will do
everything in their power to prevent scarcity of
food."</li></ul>

<p>"Your Eminence may permit me to remark that
the second clause especially is very important and
much more comforting than a previous declaration
of the Imperial Governor, that owing to occasional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
mistakes he cannot prevent the innocent population
from having to suffer with those who are guilty.
May I ask, has this favourable result been obtained
by your personal intervention?"</p>

<p>"That is to say ... yes. I have suggested
these measures and they have been consented to.
I hope that they may induce all the refugees in
The Netherlands to return at once. A press bureau
in your country has circulated the report that I
too had planned to fly. There was no truth in it
at all. It was my duty not to leave my people, is
not that so? The shepherd must stay with his
sheep, the vicars must do the same, and those who
went away must therefore come back."</p>

<p>"Your Eminence visited Malines last Tuesday,
I have been told. I may perhaps ask how you
found the condition of the cathedral and the
town?"</p>

<p>The cardinal's face was overclouded suddenly,
and quietly he answered:</p>

<p>"Pardon me, it is perhaps better not to say a
word about that for the moment. We are living
through difficult times."</p>

<p>I understood and respected the restraint of the
Belgian primate, who went on then:</p>

<p>"Tuesday of next week I hope to be at Malines
again, and on the 20th of this month the administrative
service of the archdiocese will be reinstalled."</p>

<p>"Then you will stay again at the episcopal palace,
your Eminence?"</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly. It will take time of course,
but the damage done to the St. Rombout church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
and the palace is not irreparable; the church has
suffered very much, the spire is less damaged."</p>

<p>"Much will be needed to repair what has been
damaged in this unfortunate country."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. An immense amount will be necessary.
We are about to form committees; but so
much is needed. In England they are also forming
committees, and I have received money already
from England, Scotland, and Ireland, and The
Netherlands...."</p>

<p>For a moment he gave way to emotion. He
hesitated for a few seconds, and I saw tears in his
eyes. He then went on with a trembling voice:</p>

<p>"The Netherlands is a generous country. How
grateful, how immensely grateful am I to the
Netherland people for what they have done for poor
refugees. I cannot sufficiently express my gratitude.
I have received reports from priests who came back,
and I am deeply moved by them. They told me
how at Roosendaal the Netherland soldiers gave
all their bread to the refugees, knowing well that
for some time they themselves would not get any
other. No! I can never be sufficiently grateful
for such sacrifices. And Catholics and non-Catholics
all joined in it. That is beautiful, very, very
beautiful."</p>

<p>"Your Eminence, what The Netherlands did for
the poor Belgians came from the heart of the people,
and I know for certain that the Catholics will be
eager to contribute to the rebuilding of the destroyed
churches and houses."</p>

<p>"The Netherlands has done already so much,
but if it would come to the assistance of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
unfortunate people also in this way it would greatly
gladden the archiepiscopal government, who will be
only too happy to accept gifts in these difficult
times; and perhaps the Right Reverend Netherland
bishops may be willing to send the gifts for this
purpose to us. We might then distribute those
gifts among the parishes in the country which have
suffered most."</p>

<p>"Well, in any case, your Eminence, I promise to
bring it to the knowledge of the Catholics in The
Netherlands, and you may rely upon their readiness.
But now I will not take more of your valuable time,
which you give so zealously to the poor and the
unfortunate. I thank you very much for having
granted me this audience."</p>

<p>"It was in the interests of our suffering country,
and we are those who ought to be grateful. May
I insist once more that you ask our refugees to come
back to Antwerp and don't omit to state the three
favourable regulations...."</p>

<p>His Eminence then got up, kindly offered me his
hand, the ring on which I kissed, and escorted me
to the door in the amiable, simple way of which I
shall retain the memory for ever.</p>

<p>I can see now once more how little Germans care
about the given word. They asked and obtained
from Cardinal Mercier his co-operation to incite
the population to return, but the cardinal, always
anxious to safeguard his compatriots, made conditions
to which they consented.</p>

<p>The first of them was that no young man should
be taken to Germany, or compelled to work. Now
how many lads are not already in Germany, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
many have not been compelled, especially in both
the Flanders, to do work for the Germans? And
were not loyal people who refused to do it imprisoned?
Yes! Did not these violators of law
and right proclaim that all appeal to international
agreements would be useless? "We shall no longer
punish a whole population for the deeds of individuals,"
they also promised Cardinal Mercier.
But many communities have had fines and taxes
imposed upon them in consequence of the offence
of one individual.</p>

<p>And although they also promised to do everything
in their power to prevent lack of food in
Belgium, they have bled to death the unfortunate
country by continuous impositions and taxes, and
thrown many into poverty and misery.</p>

<p>Yes, in the most scandalous manner they have
violated the promises which the Germans gave
Cardinal Mercier. But what signifies a word if
treaties are only "scraps of paper?"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />

THE ILL-TREATMENT OF BRITISH
WOUNDED</h2>

<p>I <small>RETURNED</small> from Louvain by military train. This
one had had a most adventurous journey before it
reached Louvain. It had left Cambrai in North
France three days before, always going slowly and
making long stops, to spare the seriously wounded
at least a little. I estimated that in my train over
2,000 wounded had been loaded in a long, dismal
procession of wagons. Most of them had not had
their bandages renewed for a fortnight, and were
still wearing the first emergency dressing; all came
from the neighbourhood of Arras.</p>

<p>A little to the north of this town many had been
lying wounded in the trenches for over eight days,
without being able to get their wounds bandaged.
They had to admit the success of the French field
artillery, which produced a most serious effect.</p>

<p>The Germans all agreed that their right wing
lacked artillery. The German soldiers who fell
there were all killed in their trenches by the falling
bombs, there was not sufficient field artillery to
answer this murderous fire efficiently, and they
could not do anything with their rifles against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
invisible enemy. The artillery fire of the French
was most serious from the 1st to the 4th of October,
and during those days the German trenches must
have been a real hell. On October 4th a general
"sauve qui peut" began from the trenches.</p>

<p>But the shell-fire of the French overtook them
then, as they were retreating, while many others
were killed by bombs from French aeroplanes,
which were in action in great numbers. The retreat
had not stopped before the Germans arrived in
Cambray, where the thousands of wounded could
at last be put in long trains and sent to Aix-la-Chapelle.
A great many bombs from aeroplanes
also hit these trains and killed a great many; my
own train was everywhere pierced by fragments of
those bombs. Within the carriages it was unendurable;
the wounded men and their malodorous
bandages had occupied them such a long time that
the atmosphere was simply insupportable. Happily
there was a corridor, where I stood all the time, with
the little girl, in the company of some German
military men who were sent home, not on account
of wounds, but because of internal complaints.</p>

<p>Very slowly the huge monster sauntered along,
stopping and waiting everywhere to allow long
trains with fresh troops to pass. These came
straight from Germany, with the youngest levies
and volunteers who had just finished their drill.
These had decorated their trains all over with green
boughs and outside painted all sorts of caricatures,
from which especially King George had to suffer
much. Then one read "To Paris, to England,"
and similar hopeful devices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span></p>

<p>When their train approached ours they looked
out of the windows, or opened the doors, and waved
and greeted and shouted at the top of their voices.</p>

<p>But as soon as these "tender-foots" came alongside
our train and were not met with the same
impetuous enthusiasm as they displayed themselves,
but, on the contrary, saw sick, discouraged, exhausted
faces gazing at them distressedly, their boisterousness
suddenly extinguished, and a nervous, terrified
expression pursed up their mouths. And the trains
were already at some distance from each other
before the young soldiers remembered that they
ought to shout and to wave to those who had
already done so much for the Fatherland.</p>

<p>We arrived at Landen, a place between Tirlemont
and Waremme, where we had a stop of forty minutes,
in order to feed the wounded. Soup was served
from large washing-tubs, and I and my small
companion were also offered some of this soldiers'
food. When I had finished my meal, and walked
up and down the platform in order to stretch my
legs, my attention was drawn to an uproar in front
of one of the last wagons. I went there, and shall
not forget what I saw as long as I live; I wish that
I had never seen it.</p>

<p>Amongst some Frenchmen, three British soldiers,
seriously wounded, were lying on some straw. They
looked distressed, and I thought that their condition
was critical. I was told that these men had not
had any food for five days, and now there stood in
front of the open wagon doors two to three hundred
German soldiers, partly slightly wounded, who were
well able to walk, partly German soldiers of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
Landen garrison, who had been told off for distributing
the soup. These two to three hundred men
raged and jeered at those three unfortunate, heavily
wounded British soldiers, who had not eaten for
five days, and lay groaning helplessly on some dirty
straw in a cattle-truck. The steaming tubs with
hot soup were shown them, and these Germans
shouted at them: "You want to eat, swine, swine;
you ought to be killed! Beat them to death!&mdash;beat
them to death! Here, that's what you ought to
get!"</p>

<p>As they spoke these last words they aimed their
rifles at the unfortunate, bleeding, helpless, and
hungry creatures. Others spat on their clothes
and in their faces, and the enraged Germans foamed
at the mouth.</p>

<p>With weak eyes, eyes telling of approaching death,
one of them gazed at these cruel torturers, or looked
hungrily at the steaming soup; the two others had
turned their heads on one side and closed their eyes.
But at last also the third turned off his head and
closed his eyes, sighing and groaning. In the
meantime the Germans went on threatening them,
blurting out all sorts of filthy abuse, spitting or
threatening them with their rifles, while others were
laughing and enjoying the helplessness of those
three.</p>

<p>I stood still, dumb, aghast, unable to utter a word.
Then I went to a sergeant who was also looking on
and laughing; and, trembling all over, I said:</p>

<p>"What is happening here is frightful; those men
are also human beings, who had to do their duty as
much as you!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span></p>

<p>I couldn't say more, my voice stuck in my throat.</p>

<p>And what was his answer?</p>

<p>"What? Do their duty? No, they are swine&mdash;paid
swine; they get money for their dirty work,
the swine!"</p>

<p>I did not answer. I could not. Silently I
looked a little longer at the beastly scene, only
sorry that I was not a giant who, with one strong
hand, might restrain the roughs, and refresh with
the other the burning, feverish lips of the wretched
men.</p>

<p>What distressed me most was that among those
two to three hundred soldiers in front of that open
cattle-truck was not one man who wanted to take
the part of these unfortunate British; no, not one!</p>

<p>When I reported the occurrence in <i>De Tijd</i>, I was
fully conscious of the frightful accusation implied
by my information; but I am prepared to confirm
with the most sacred oaths that nothing in this
accusation is untrue or exaggerated.</p>

<p>I was not afraid of an inquiry, but asked for it
as a matter of fact, by writing in my report:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And if the German authorities intend to institute a
serious and impartial inquiry, then I give them the following
particulars:</p>

<p>"It happened at Landen on Friday, October 9th, in the
train with wounded which arrived there from Brussels at
about noon, when food was being distributed."</p></blockquote>

<p>The German authorities have indeed made
inquiries about the matter; I shall deal with that
in the next chapter.</p>

<p>What happened at Landen made a very deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
impression upon me; it shocked me more than all
the terrible things which I had seen during the
war and all the dangers which I went through.
When the train went on again, and the soldiers
began to speak to me once more, I was unable to
utter a word and sat there musing.</p>

<p>Before I witnessed this terrible event at Landen
some Germans in the train had already told me
that they simply killed the British whom they made
prisoners. Others assured me that such a thing
did not happen in their division, but one asserted
that by his company alone already twenty-six had
been killed. I did not believe them then, and
thought that they were better than they made
themselves out, but after having witnessed that
scene at Landen ...!</p>

<p>One hour before the arrival at Liège the engine
of our train dashed into another, and got so badly
damaged that all the water from our engine ran
away. This caused a delay of another two hours,
so that we did not arrive at Liège before dusk, and
could not think of reaching The Netherlands that day.</p>

<p>I took the little Amsterdam girl to my niece in
the convent of the Sisters of Mercy, and went to
an hotel myself. A German newspaper, bought
at a bookstall, gave in gigantic type the information
that Antwerp might fall at any moment, and a
recently posted bulletin brought the feared-for
news. But the people of Liège could not, and would
not believe it.</p>

<p>I had expected it and believed the reports, but it
hurt all the same. I had had intercourse with
German soldiers almost exclusively; but that gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
me a much better opportunity for observing their
conduct, which roused in me a deep sympathy for
the poor, oppressed Belgian people. That was
why I was so sorry to hear of the fall of Antwerp,
although I was not discouraged. Right would
triumph, and the day come when the Belgian
nation would shake off the foreign yoke of tyranny,
and repair in peace and prosperity, under the
sagacious rule of their king, what barbarians destroyed
and pulled down.</p>

<p>The next day I got to The Netherlands with my
small protégée, after a tiring walk from Herstal to
Eysden, where we could take the train to Maastricht.
Here the father of the little girl came to meet his
daughter, and took her to Amsterdam, to her
"Mummy," of whom she had been speaking during
the whole journey with so much longing.</p>

<p>Only now did I hear what had happened to the
village of Lanaeken after I had seen the German
preparations in Tongres for action against the little
Belgian army that was still about in the north-eastern
part of the country. The greater part of
Lanaeken had been destroyed by shelling, and of
course a great many innocent victims had fallen in
consequence.</p>

<p>By destroying the life and possessions of peaceful
civilians the Germans&mdash;who always boast so much
about their military honour&mdash;gave unconscious
expression to their awe of the fearless heroes who
still stood their ground to the north of Liège, whilst
the Germans were still besieging Antwerp.</p>

<p class="p2">I have mentioned already that the German autho<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>rities
had ordered a so-called inquiry about what
happened at Landen. As the result of this inquiry
the press of all neutral countries had the following
two official communications wired to them:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<i>Berlin, November 10th.</i> (E. B.).&mdash;A correspondent of
<i>De Tijd</i> in Amsterdam has told a number of details about the
so-called bad treatment of British wounded at the station of
Landen, according to which the British had been left without
food or drink, had been spit in their faces, and our soldiers
were alleged to have aimed their rifles at them. The German
Government had instituted a thorough inquiry into this
matter and publish the result: 'The entire allegation of the
correspondent is untrue. None of the details is covered by
the facts. The British have not been beaten nor pushed nor
spit at, but on the contrary warm food was offered them,
which was accepted by all except two. Store-inspector
Huebner and the landwehr-soldier Krueger have testified to
this."</p>

<p>"<i>Berlin, November 10th.</i> (W. B.) Official.&mdash;The <i>Norddeutsche
Allgemeine Zeitung</i> writes: 'The daily newspaper,
<i>De Tijd</i>, issued at Amsterdam, published on October 16th
a report from a war correspondent at Maastricht, in which he
asserted that on October 9th a train in which more than
two thousand wounded were transported, arrived at the station
at Landen in Belgium between Tirlemont and Waremme.
Here it was said that a stop had taken place of forty minutes
in which to provide the wounded with food. Walking up
and down the platform the reporter pretends to have seen two
to three hundred German soldiers, slightly wounded men and
men of the garrison of Landen, furiously abuse three seriously
wounded British, who were lying in one of the last carriages
of the train. They showed mugs full of steaming soup to
the hungry British, whom they left lying there miserable
from starvation. They were also said to have aimed their
rifles at them, laughing roughly, and to have spit on them.</p>

<p>"'These allegations of the reporter of <i>De Tijd</i> caused the
authorities to institute inquiries, and the following is now
stated with regard to the alleged events:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span></p>
<p>"'On October 9th no train with two thousand wounded
arrived at the station of Landen, but only small transports
whose number can be checked accurately by the lists of
wounded. Rioting by two to three hundred soldiers near a
carriage could not take place, as the station guard was instructed
to keep free a path along the train. There is, moreover,
always an officer of the station-guard present, when a
train with wounded leaves. It is impossible that the soldiers
could have aimed their rifles at the British, as the men who
get their food in the dining-hall, as also the serving military
personnel, are always unarmed. Other soldiers are not
admitted to the station. The British have neither been
beaten, nor stabbed, nor spit at; on the contrary plates full
of hot soup have been offered them which were refused by
two of them. This has been confirmed by the declarations
of people who were present.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course I did not withhold my answer, pilloried
the hardly serious inquiry of the Germans, and
published immediately an extensive contradiction in
<i>De Tijd</i>. I quote the following from it:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Only about a month after the publication of my story
about what happened at Landen, the German Government
and military authorities considered that the time had come
to contradict it, after ordering an inquiry which in reality
cannot be called an inquiry at all. From their communiqués
it is clear that some soldiers were heard who probably were
privy to the act, and in any case benefited by a denial of the
villainy committed at Landen. That is to say, men who were
counsel in their own cause, and who were believed the sooner
because their declarations were desirable for the support of
German credit. But it does not appear from these communiqués
that the German authorities also examined the
wounded who were present, nor the two Netherlanders who
travelled by that train: the young Miss de Bruin, from
Amsterdam, and the present writer, as also the civilian witnesses
at Landen. In opposition to the evidence of Stores-inspector
Huebner and the landwehr-soldier Krueger, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
which evidence it has not been stated that they gave it on
oath, I declare myself prepared and willing, if a complete and
impartial inquiry be instituted, to declare upon oath either
to a properly qualified committee in The Netherlands or in
Germany, or to a thereto-appointed arbiter, the following:</p>

<p>"'1. On Friday, the ninth of October, at noon, I stopped
at Landen about forty minutes after arriving from Louvain in
a terribly long train of passenger carriages and goods vans, with
approximately two thousand wounded. (This estimate may be
wrong to the extent of a couple of hundred, but that does not
matter.) During this time the wounded were fed.</p>

<p>"'I saw how two to three hundred German soldiers, part
of them slightly wounded, who were well able to walk, partly
soldiers of the Landen garrison, who crowded about the open
doors of one of the last wagons, raging and jeering against
three seriously wounded British soldiers, about whom their
French fellow-passengers told me that they had had nothing
to eat for five days. The wounded were called "swine," were
spit at, and some rifles were aimed at them. When I told a
sergeant that it was a disgusting scene, he answered: "These
British swine, they get paid for their filthy work." He alluded
to the pay which the British volunteers receive because they
enlist as mercenaries, Britain having no compulsory general
military service. Before I witnessed this awful thing at
Landen, Germans in the train had already told me that they
simply killed any British whom they made prisoners. Others
said that such a thing did not happen in their division, but
one man contended that by his company already twenty-six
had been killed. I did not believe them, and thought that
they were better than they pretended to be.</p>

<p>"'2. The soup had been offered to the British, but two
refused to take it, says the German Government. Yes, it was
offered these wretched people, but, as I have said already, the
German soldiers kept the steaming soup before them, shouting
at them: "You want to eat, you swine!&mdash;you swine! you
ought to be killed! This is what you may have!" And as
they said the latter they aimed their rifles at the unfortunate
men, whilst others who were not armed lifted up their fists
and threatened them, or spat at them.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span></p>
<p>"'In my report about the occurrence I had not even exposed
in all its harshness the treatment dealt out to the French
soldiers. For they too were not offered plates of soup, but
only the mugs were filled, forming part of their equipment.
And there were many who put out these mugs as if supplicating
to have them filled once more; as that was not done they
constantly put the empty mug to their mouth to try and lick
off any remaining drops that might have stuck to its side.
Some Germans said: "Yes, the French may have something,
for they are soldiers, but those three there, well, they are paid
swine."</p>

<p>"'3. I published the facts and insisted upon an impartial
inquiry, in order to prevent, if possible, that only guilty soldiers
should be heard should a complaint about the occurrence be
lodged with the highest military authority.</p>

<p>"'Instead of facing such an impartial inquiry with an
examination of all available witnesses and punishment of the
guilty, the German government finds the courage only to
call me, a month after the event, "a liar," and the whole
story a fairy-tale!</p>

<p>"'If the German government had come somewhat earlier
with their contradiction, it might have been possible to cite
another witness, for&mdash;I have not reported that at first&mdash;among
those who were present there was a civilian, an inhabitant of
Landen, who also looked with anger at the cruel scene, and
expressed his indignation when he could no longer restrain
himself. But then there was a general outcry of:</p>

<p>"'"What is this civilian doing here?" The young man
could not explain his presence satisfactorily, and a couple of
soldiers got hold of him, and, in the literal sense of the word,
threw him away. When he waited at a short distance a little
longer, with an angry face, one of the soldiers ran at him,
threatening him with his bayonet. I might have been able
to find that young man at the time, but now, a month later,
this will be much more difficult. There was also another
group of civilians packed as densely as herrings in a cattle-truck
on another line; they must have seen the beastly
occurrence as well.</p>

<p>"'I might quote another small detail. Before the train<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
arrived at Landen I had had a very pleasant chat in the corridor
with a German soldier, who seemed tolerably humane and
civilised, even in his talk. After the departure from Landen
I again got into conversation with him, and did not fail to
express my indignation; and then he gave me the following
reply: "Oh well, one must think of the position of our
soldiers, who have been for days in the trenches under the
murderous fire of the enemy. Later on they will themselves
repent for what has happened." Perhaps the German government
may be able to discover who that soldier is, if I add that
he went home for good because he was suffering from heart-disease.</p>

<p>"'And then there is something else. The brakesman of
the wagon in which I travelled was a man who had enlisted
only a couple of weeks ago as a volunteer for the service on the
railways, and, if I remember correctly, hailed from Hamburg.
He belonged to a Trades Union which had already once made
a trip to Amsterdam and Rotterdam, and was for instance
able to tell me that Krasnapolsky at Amsterdam was a large
hotel. I also spoke to that man about what had happened,
because I thought I had noticed that he was more human,
but he too gave me the cynical answer: "Oh well, the French
may have something to eat, they fight also for their country,
but not those British, they only fight because that is their
profession."</p>

<p>"'4. With regard to the arms of the German soldiers, it is
true that the wounded men had none with them, but I
have distinctly stated that the crowd consisted of soldiers who
belonged to the lightly wounded and of soldiers belonging to
the Landen garrison. These latter had been told off to guard
the station and the platforms and maintain order. It is
possible that they had also to prevent the wounded from
moving about on the platforms, but in that case they did not
stick to their task, because everybody was free to go
where he liked, and I myself did the same. That these
guards did not guard anything at all at the moment is proved
by the fact that the above-mentioned civilian was able
to come near the riot, although he had to pass a number of
platforms. That the soldiers belonged to the Landen garrison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
and had to do sentry-go is proved by the fact that they had
their bayonets on their rifles.</p>

<p>"'Finally, the contention that no riot could have taken
place because the soldiers were fed in the dining-hall is entirely
incorrect. That dining-hall was nothing but a shed entirely
open at the front, in which there were a few seats. There the
slightly wounded soldiers were fed first, and when they had
supplied those, food was taken to the seriously wounded, who
had to stop in the train, as also to myself and my little companion.
The slightly wounded and the soldiers of the guard
walked off with the distributors of the soup along the train
in order to have a chat with their comrades in it. In that
way they also came to the British when the wagon-door had
been opened. It will be evident that I observed closely and
retained in my memory all that had happened there and in
the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>"'5. My pertinent declarations are now opposed by the
German official contradiction; but how weak is the argument!
I have already pointed out that only comrades of the accused
men have been heard, but not the accuser, nor, as is evident,
the victims, nor other witnesses. There is more: "Crowding
of two to three hundred soldiers near a wagon cannot occur"&mdash;thus
says the communiqué&mdash;"because the station-guard's
duty is to keep free the path along the train." Does anyone
understand the weakness of this contradiction? It is as if
one should say: "It is impossible that anything has been
stolen in a town because it is the duty of the police to
guard it." "Moreover there is also always an officer of the
station-guard present at the departure of a train of wounded,"
the communiqué proceeds. But again I ask: What does
this prove? It is a fact that this officer, if he was present,
did not prevent what happened. "It is impossible that
the soldiers aimed their rifles at the British, because the men
who get their food in the dining-hall, and those of the military
who distribute it, are always unarmed; no other soldiers are
admitted to the station." I see that the German government
simply quote the military regulations, and from them determine
the facts. They cannot realise that it might be
possible for their regulations not to be obeyed always.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span></p>
<p>"'6. I am convinced that on the whole the treatment of the
wounded was generous and exemplary. But it is also a fact
that the terrible hatred of the Germans against the British,
encouraged by their military authorities (one has to think of
the proclamation of Prince Rupert of Bavaria) and their
scandalous comic papers, which disgust even decent Germans,
induce to extravagances such as I witnessed at Landen. Did
not a German officer explain to an editor of the <i>Algemeen
Handelsolad</i> (evening issue of October 18th): "The unwritten
order is to make everywhere as many French and as few
English prisoners as possible; we don't try to wound, but
to kill the British."'"</p></blockquote>

<p>I think that my answer left nothing to be desired
for plainness, and Germany cannot have derived
much pleasure from its official contradiction. Moreover,
the editor of <i>De Tijd</i> had also made inquiries
from the little girl whom I escorted from Louvain
on the day of the occurrence at Landen, and
although I admit at once that not too great a value
can be attached to the evidence of a girl of nine, I
insert here what the editor wrote about that
interview:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Our editor has moreover interviewed young Miss Antoinette
de Bruijn here, whom our correspondent brought from
Louvain to Maastricht. In the presence of her mother she
told how she had been in a train full of wounded, that there
were armed soldiers on the platform, and that some wounded
soldiers had been teased by offering them steaming soup which
was not given to them. The father of this girl, Mr. de Bruijn,
also assured us that when he met his daughter at Maastricht,
our correspondent, Mr. Mokveld, was still very much under
the impression of what he had witnessed."</p></blockquote>

<p>My contradiction became known in Germany,
and it was an eye-opener to a great many people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
there. The editor of <i>De Tijd</i> received many letters
from that country, and printed some of them with
the name of the writer added. From these it seems
that even there it was acknowledged in some circles
that the German inquiry had been extremely one-sided,
and that it would have been wiser to admit
what had happened at Landen, and punish the
culprits.</p>

<p>The only purpose of my publication was to convince
everybody of this, and thereby prevent the
repetition of such a scandalous scene.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />

ON THE YSER</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> the pretty town of Sluys in the Netherland
part of Flanders I made a good many trips to the
Belgian coastal regions and the Yser, the little river
that will always be named in history, because there
came the end of the German advance, and there
the Belgian army displayed all its power, fighting
with the courage of lions in defence of the last bit
of their native soil.</p>

<p>Yes, Sluys will always live in my memory. How
well have been received the thousands of Belgians
who went there for shelter and how much misery
have I seen relieved by the effectual mutual help
of the Belgians and that of the civil and military
Netherland authorities. The burgomaster in particular
seemed to be the right man in the right place,
and it was chiefly due to his sagacity that everything
went so regularly in that small town, which
had to maintain the proportionately greatest number
of refugees.</p>

<p>In Sluys I also got to know by friendly intercourse
the character of the Belgians, so open, so straightforward,
and so bright.</p>

<p>From this town I got the best connections with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
the West of Belgium, and as a rule I always made
my first visit to ancient and pretty Bruges, which
was constantly strongly occupied by the Germans.
In front of the well-known Halls two small guns
had been mounted, threatening the market-square.
The same was the case in front of the Palace of
Justice, where the commander's office was established.
The Government buildings in the market
were entirely occupied by the naval staff of Admiral
von Schroeder, and dozens of sailors were sitting
in the offices, working at their typewriting machines.</p>

<p>Soldiers came from and went back to the Yser,
which river I saw three times during the fierce
fighting.</p>

<p>The first time when the Germans had only been
there for about ten days, and huge masses were sent
to the scene of battle, because they had decided
to break through at any cost.</p>

<p>Along the coast the German line did not reach
far beyond Mariakerke, where a big German flag
on a high dune indicated their most advanced
front. Thanks to the consent of a couple of officers
I was allowed to push on to the front lines, and did
this in spite of the danger from bursting shrapnel.
The wounded had to walk back from there to Ostend,
very often suffering the most trying pains, because,
according to what they told me, the Red Cross
Service was not able to help them all. They were
very dissatisfied on account of the waste of human
life by which the attacks were accompanied, and
some made bitter remarks about the staff which
seemed to be mad, constantly sending new troops
into the murderous fire with such evident callousness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span></p>

<p>I have been able to assist a good many of these
unfortunate people by bandaging the wounds with
the dressing they gave me, or getting some water
for them from some house in the neighbourhood;
and one, who had fallen down exhausted by pain,
I carried into a house.</p>

<p>I had more trouble with a wretch who, being
heavily wounded in both legs, lay on the top of a
dune beyond Mariakerke. He was quite alone, and
when he discovered me his eyes glistened, full of
hope. He told me of his agonies, and beseeched
me to take him to a house or an ambulance. However
much I should have liked to do that, it was
impossible in the circumstances in which I found
myself. Nowhere, even in the farthest distance,
was a house to be seen, and I tried to explain the
position to him. But he turned a deaf ear to all my
exhortations, and insisted that I should help him.
It was a painful business, for I could not do the
impossible. So I promised him, and took my oath
that I should warn the first ambulance I met, and
see to it that they came and fetched him.</p>

<p>I went away urging him to maintain his courage
for the time being, but he had scarcely noticed that
I was about to go, when his eyes began to gleam and
to roll in his head; then he took his rifle, which was
lying by his side, and I, seeing his intention, ran
down the dune as quickly as possible, whilst I heard
the well-known click-clack behind me; the man
had fired two bullets at me....</p>

<p>I must not take that sort of thing amiss. Who
knew with how much pain and how long he had
been lying there, facing death, but fearing it too.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
At last someone came near, and he put all his hope
in that man, but a hope that vanished. Yes,
I can quite understand that a man in those conditions
goes mad.</p>

<p>I was not able to stay long at Mariakerke, but
succeeded, by going in an easterly direction, to get
near Leke, where the fight was also in full swing,
and where evidently the same command had been
issued: "Advance at any cost." The German
artillery stood south of Leke, but I succeeded in
pushing on to a hill near the road, where I could
see the columns of smoke of the Belgian artillery
and the clouds of dust which the German shrapnel
threw up.</p>

<p>The Germans advanced in a formation which I
had never seen yet. The men went at the double-quick
in closed ranks three abreast, each of the
threefold files marching at a small distance from
the other.</p>

<p>They stormed the Belgian lines with lowered
bayonets. The Belgians quietly allowed them to
come near, but as soon as they were at a certain
distance from the trenches they wished to take, I
heard the rattle of the mitrailleuses, and the thunder
of the guns. The storming soldiers then disappeared
in a fog of smoke and dust, in which I saw
their shadows fall and stagger. This went on for
about ten minutes, and then they came back in
complete disorder, still followed by the hostile
bullets and shrapnel.</p>

<p>A period of calm followed, but not for long, for
again and again new attacks were made.</p>

<p>I myself was not very safe either, for frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
bursting shells fell near me. I therefore thought
it safer to cross to a farm-house a hundred yards
farther on, where I might find shelter. Before
I got there an officer of a passing division took
me violently by the arm and asked who I was and
what I was doing there? His eyes glittered savagely,
and he as well as his men seemed to be fearfully
excited.</p>

<p>I said in a few words who I was, and showed one
of my German permits. He had scarcely seen the
many German stamps on it when he let me go
and went on with his men. I then pinned on my
coat two permits which had the greatest number
of stamps, and in consequence had no further
trouble.</p>

<p>From the garret-window of the farm-house I
followed the fierce battle for another half-hour,
and saw that the Germans suffered enormous
losses, but achieved no gains. At last I had to
leave this place too, because shells fell again quite
near to the house. I stayed another ten minutes
near an ambulance, where they were quite unable
to attend to the numerous wounded men. Most
of them got an emergency dressing, and were
advised to go higher up and try to get better attention
there.</p>

<p>The battle I saw that day on the Yser was the
beginning of the trench-war in that district. Many
Belgian troops had dug themselves in, and later on
this system was extended, in consequence of which
the Belgian line there became impregnable.</p>

<p>In those days German Headquarters gave continuously
the thoughtless order: "To Calais, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
Calais," and the Staff considered no difficulties,
calculated no sacrifices, in order to achieve success.</p>

<p>What these frenzied orders have cost in human
lives History will tell later on.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As soon as the Germans were near the coast
they began to fortify it most formidably, in order
to prevent eventual attempts at landing by hostile
troops. Guns were soon mounted in the dunes,
as I noticed during a trip which I made along the
coast on Sunday, October 25th.</p>

<p>Heyst was occupied by a small division of marines,
although a few days before the garrison had been
larger, but on Saturday evening all soldiers along
the coast had been alarmed, and most of them were
ordered to proceed to the battle-field near Nieuwpoort,
where matters were at the time less favourable
for the Germans. Near the dyke I found five pieces
of ordnance mounted, their mouths turned towards
the sea, and that they were quite right in taking
precautions was proved by the men-of-war riding
on the distant horizon, without motion.</p>

<p>In the centre of the town I was detained by three
sailors, who called out an angry "Halt!" seized my
bicycle, and made me a prisoner, "because I was
an Englishman." Happily I could prove the
contrary by my papers; and the permit of the
Bruges commander to go about on a bicycle made
them return it.</p>

<p>There was a general complaint in that district
about the very arbitrary requisitions: for example,
beds and blankets were extensively taken away from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
the convents, a thing against which the burgomaster
of Bruges had already protested. Horses, cows,
and other cattle were simply taken from the stables
and the meadows, and paid for with paper promises.</p>

<p>At Zeebrugge the conditions were not alarming.
The houses of those who had gone away, however,
had been damaged most terribly, and looted. Round
the harbour guns were mounted, guarded by many
sentries. I was at first forbidden to cross the canal
bridge, but my excellent credentials at length made
the sentries give in. Everything indicated that
already during the first days of the occupation the
Germans had begun to execute their plan to turn
Zeebrugge into a station for submarines.</p>

<p>The commander ruled with a strong hand. They
issued not only the usual proclamations about introducing
German time, but the commander went even
so far as to dictate at what hour the Holy Masses
had to be said. In one of the proclamations I
read, for example, that in future the Mass of six
o'clock, Belgian time, had to be said at the same
hour German time. Another proclamation said
that skippers were forbidden to sail, and that all
boats, including fisher-boats, had been seized.</p>

<p>In the dunes near Ostend I came across a level field
fenced off by the military, and in the centre I saw a
large company of superior officers, and a marine
band. They were arranged round three big caves,
into which just then had been lowered nine military
officers and ordinary soldiers, who died in the nearly
completed new Military Hospital of Ostend in the
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>With a powerful voice, in order to drown the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
roar of the guns, a German parson delivered the
funeral oration, in which he spoke of the heroic
conduct of the fallen men, who had sacrificed their
lives for God, Kaiser, and Fatherland, and who,
by God's inscrutable decree, were not destined to
witness the final victory of the powerful German
armies. The marines put their instruments to
their mouths and played a slow funeral march.
It was really very touching, and all the spectators
came under the impression.</p>

<p>Whilst yet the sweet strains of the music sounded
over the dunes, the dull booming of the heavy field-artillery
was heard constantly, and each boom
meant the end of so many more human lives. The
music went on, and the officers approached one
after the other to throw a handful of sand on the
corpses of their fallen comrades. I saw their nostrils
tremble, saw them bite their lips nervously, saw
tears in their eyes.</p>

<p>The ceremony wound up with a short silent prayer
offered at the request of the parson.</p>

<p>The funeral had deeply moved me, and full of
emotion I approached the edge of the graves. I
saw three corpses in each of them, simply wrapped
in a clean, white sheet. The only decorations were
some green palm branches ... the branches telling
of peace.</p>

<p>A little farther on I discovered a good many other
mounds. A cross made of two little pieces of wood
stood on each, amongst pots with flowers and small
posies. On one of the crosses I saw written in
pencil&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Captain Count Von Schwerin, 19. 10.'14."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>

It was very interesting, because a humble private
had been buried by his side.</p>

<p>Of course I did not know this Count von Schwerin,
but because I had just witnessed that funeral, and
because it was so striking that men of every class
were buried in the same manner, I reported what
I saw to my paper. And, tragic fate, in consequence
of this, the wife of the late Count heard for the first
time of the death of her husband to whom she, a
Netherland baroness, had been married at the
beginning of the war. At the request of the family
I made arrangements so that the grave might be
recognised after the war.</p>

<p>In Ostend every place was full of wounded men,
who all came walking from the battle-field in groups.
Even in those days the fierce fights continued in
consequence of the mad attempts to conquer
Dunkirk and Calais. Great losses were suffered
also by the enormous effect of the British naval guns,
against which the German marines had mounted
big guns in Ostend and farther along the coast,
in order to keep the fleet at a distance.</p>

<p>On the day of my visit to Ostend all sorts of
conveyances had taken more than 3,000 wounded
into the town. Peasants from the neighbourhood
were compelled to harness their horses and transport
the unfortunate men. Such a procession was distressing
to look at, as most men lay on open carts,
only supported by a handful of newly cut straw,
and long processions entered the town continuously.
As reinforcements had arrived, the divisions of
the German army which had suffered most came
sometimes from the front to the town, in order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
to have a rest, and then I saw a great deal of
misery.</p>

<p>Some of the soldiers were furious and others
distressed on account of the great number of
comrades left on the battle-field, while they hardly
made any progress against the tenacity of the Allies.
Those who were not seriously wounded were not
even put up in hospitals or similar buildings, as
there was only room for a few, although many private
houses had been turned into supplementary hospitals.
In the streets and the cafés I saw therefore hundreds
of men in bandages.</p>

<p>The condition of the civilian population was not
too roseate. Most of them were away, and from
those who had stayed everything was requisitioned.
Staying in the town was not without danger, for
two days before my visit it had been bombarded
from noon to one o'clock by the British fleet, by
which an hotel on the boulevard and some houses
in the Rue des Flamands had been damaged.</p>

<p>From Ostend I went a few days later to Thourout,
a townlet to the north of the centre of the Yser-line.
I was accompanied by two Netherland
colleagues whom I had met at Bruges. Everything
was quiet there; the commander of the naval
region, Admiral von Schroeder, had made himself
slightly ridiculous, by informing the population in
a proclamation that he had ordered the British
citizens in the coastal region to leave the country,
in order to protect them from their fellow-countrymen
of the British fleet, who, by bombarding Ostend,
had endangered their lives.</p>

<p>As we left through the Gate-of-Bruges towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
Thourout we were approached by a small military
group, a few German soldiers who escorted about
a dozen French and Belgian prisoners of war.
Until that moment the street had been relatively
quiet, but the inhabitants had scarcely heard that
the "boys" came, when each ran into the street,
forgetting all fear of the "Duuts," and, breaking
through the escort, they gave their "boys" an
apple, or a pear, or a packet of cigarettes; so we
saw a huge round of white bread fly through the air
and land in the hands of one of the "boys." Such
a thing touches one always, and even the escorting
Germans, who at first were very indignant on account
of the sudden and unexpected intrusion, left the
citizens alone with a generous gesture, as to say:
"Well, have your way."</p>

<p>The other eleven miles of the road to Thourout
were quite deserted, and only in one place did I see
a man working in the field. We only saw now and
again a small escort which overtook us. From afar
a trooper approached us; after having heard who
we were, he told us that he had been on the way
already three days and three nights from the trench
lines, and how fierce the fighting was there. The
German losses had been immense; he pointed to
the unoccupied horse by his side, and said: "My
chum, whose horse this was, fell also." He took
a couple of strong pulls at his pipe, and, spurring
his mount, rode off with a: "Keep well."</p>

<p>At Thourout all convents and large buildings had
been turned into hospitals, and the streets on both
sides were full of big wagons. Hundreds of soldiers
went off, and large convoys of carts were standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
in the meadows and on the roads, where officers
and men were also practising riding. We were
here in the rear, where there was a continuous going
and coming from the front. Most soldiers were
in a more or less excited mood; some did not hide
their discontent, or sat musing dejectedly, asking
themselves how these terrible days would end for
them? Others again seemed to have got into a
sort of frenzy in consequence of the continuous
fighting and were not able to think logically at all.
They told excited stories about the British whom
they had killed, and chased away from the 42 c.m.
guns, who, according to them, were also at work in
the swampy soil near Nieuwpoort, and also told
about the shooting civilians, and those cursed
Belgians, who cut open the bellies of their poor
wounded, or sliced off their noses, hands, and ears.
Of course pure fairy tales, but recited with much
power of conviction.</p>

<p>The question of lodgings brought also many
difficulties, for nobody wanted to, or could put us
up. At last we succeeded at the Hôtel l'Union,
where we first ate two roasted pigeons which were
intended for a couple of officers, who would return
in the evening from the front line. The three of
us subsequently occupied one room, after having
written on the door with chalk that Lieutenants
So and So were staying there. For the landlady
had told us that she was willing to put us up,
but that the officers who returned every night from
the front line were sure to turn us out. Indeed
in the evening we heard heavy steps before our door,
but after a voice had read out that Lieutenants So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
and So were passing the night there, they all
went away again.</p>

<p>The next morning the roar of the cannon woke
us up, and soon we heard how the fighting stood,
for when we went to the commander for a permit
to go to Dixmuiden, the sympathetic major absolutely
refused it, and haltingly added that he himself
did not yet know how things stood there. Well,
that was enough for us. At last he gave us a permit
for Ostend, and we noticed very soon that now we
were in the rear of the front. Whilst the guns were
thundering on continuously and the shrapnel
exploded in the air, we passed continuously large
contingents, who actually formed one long line.
The fight was going on only a few miles away, and
incessantly the unhappy wounded came out of the
small bypaths, stumbling on in their heavily muddied
clothes.</p>

<p>At the "Oud Slot van Vlaanderen," a large,
ancient castle, there was a lot of hustle and bustle
of carriages and motor-cars. We had not gone
another two hundred yards, when someone came
after us and stopped us as suspects. We were
escorted back to the castle, where a general command
was established, and an aviators-division, with the
motor-section attached to it. Happily our detention
did not last long, and after examination we
were released. On the road was an infernal noise,
as the violent roar of the cannon was mixing with
the roar of the wheels of the heavily-loaded convoys
and the whirr and hooting of the army motors.
Long processions of field-kitchens passed us also,
most of them brand-new; but it was remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
that all carts arranged for a team of two were
drawn with great difficulty by only one horse, and
also that so many civilians have been compelled to
act as drivers, or to gather the wounded.</p>

<p>Constantly new and large transports of wounded
came along the road, and here and there they were
busy killing and burying wounded horses. The
inhabitants locked themselves in their houses, and
expected with great fear that any moment the
military might arrive to claim their last horse or
cow. The requisitions went on continuously, and
the cattle were driven to the front in a long, desolate
procession.</p>

<p>As we went on towards Eerneghem French aviators
were heroically reconnoitring above the German
lines. One came from Dixmuiden and one from
Nieuwpoort; both went to about half-way between
these two towns, where the centre of the battle
was. The Germans kept up an unbroken artillery
fire at those birds in the air. I saw quite near
to them shells exploding right and left and
discharging dense, black clouds of smoke that
disappeared slowly. There were moments when
these black stretches of cloud seemed to form
a frame round the aeroplanes, but the brave
aviators knew how to escape from their assailants
by all sorts of tricks. They came down to go
up again unexpectedly, entirely changed their direction
a moment later, and at last both disappeared
undamaged.</p>

<p>At Eerneghem we were not only stopped, but also
sent back outright. It was considered extremely
impudent on our side that we had dared to push<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
on so far, because we were in the fighting-line.
Even the permit given by the commander of
Thourout was of no avail.</p>

<p>Back at Bruges we attended in the market the
concert given by a German military band near the
statues of Breydel and de Koninck. At the commander's
office I witnessed a remarkable incident.
A German post-official and a soldier had just brought
in a decently dressed gentleman. The postman
began to relate that he was taking away the telephone
instrument at that gentleman's house in order to
fix it up at the commander's office, and that the
gentleman had said: "Why do you steal that
instrument?" As the postman said this the commander
jumped up in a fury, and called out:</p>

<p>"What? What? Do you dare to call it stealing,
what we Germans take here in Bruges?"</p>

<p>"Sir, I do not understand German, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not a word, not a word; you have insulted a
German official, and according to the proclamation
you know that that is severely punished. You are
my prisoner."</p>

<p>As he said this the commander put his hand
roughly on the shoulder of the trembling man, who
again said in French:</p>

<p>"I have not used the word 'steal' at all, but let
me explain the matter."</p>

<p>"There is nothing to explain. Officer, you can
take your oath on it?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, captain."</p>

<p>"Well"&mdash;this to a private&mdash;"you call the patrol;
this man must be arrested."</p>

<p>The unhappy man bowed his head trembling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
and with dull resignation he left the office, strongly
escorted.</p>

<p>The man who had this experience was Mr.
Coppieters, the District Commissioner, a man who
had given all his life to the service of society and
the good of the community.</p>

<p>Happily the burgomaster intervened, and, as I
heard later, got him released.</p>

<p class="p2">These are some of the things I could tell about
my trips in the West of Belgium. By the end of
November I was no longer allowed to move freely
behind the front, although from time to time I
visited small Belgian frontier-places.</p>

<p>Yet I am glad to have witnessed the terrible
fights near the Yser a couple of times where the
German invasion was stopped, and where we may
hope that soon victory may dawn on the brave
Belgian army.</p>

themselves "Deutsch," the Americans call them "Dutch," the
Flemish use "Duts" or "Duuts," and the Netherlanders
"Duitsch"; so it is desirable to exchange "Dutch" for "Netherland."</p></div>

<p class="center"><b>The Gods in the Battle</b></p>

<p class="center">By PAUL HYACINTHE LOYSON</p>

<p class="center">Translated from the French by LADY FRAZER</p>

<p class="center">With an Introduction by H. G. WELLS</p>

<p class="center"><i>SOME EXTRACTS FROM REVIEWS OF THE
ORIGINAL</i></p>

<p><b>Le Mercure de France</b> (Marcel Rouff):</p>

<p>"P. H. Loyson's book hunts down all the subterfuges of dubious
neutralities; it gives chase to all suspicious timidities; it combats all
the criminal cavils.... All this part of the book (on Romain Rolland)
is really grand and tragic."</p>

<p><b>Georges Renard</b> (Socialist, Professor at the Collège de France):</p>

<p>"An old volunteer of 1870, like myself, cannot admit that a Frenchman
should lounge in a foreign country and hover 'above the battle' when
his country is threatened with death, together with all the human
ideals for which she stands. Therefore I applaud the shots fired by this
franc-tireur."</p>

<p><b>Le Progrès</b> (Athens):</p>

<p>"Among the innumerable books which the great war has produced
at Paris, this is one of powerful interest by a great French patriot, who
is at the same time a writer of indisputable superiority."</p>

<p><b>Boston Evening Transcript</b> (Alvan F. Sanborn):</p>

<p>"A striking contrast between the sturdiness, strenuousness, and boldness
of the <i>ante-bellum</i> pacificism of Loyson and the equivocalness and
timidity of that of Rolland."</p>

<p><b>Le Journal des Débats</b>:</p>

<p>"This masterly lesson, courageously given, will not be lost."</p>

<p><b>Le Radical</b> (Eugène Holland):</p>

<p>"Inspired by his theme, the author soars to the heights of eloquence,
which thus far had only been reached by the grand lyric flight of
D'Annunzio. This book will live."</p>

<p class="center"><small>BY</small></p>

<p class="center">EZIO M. GRAY</p>

<p class="center"><b>Translated from the Italian by BERNAND MIALL</b></p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> volume will interest the business man
and politician as well as the general public.
It shows how Germany, by means of her
industrial or money-lending banks, obtained
control of vast sums of Italian capital, and
of most Italian industries; ruining those
which competed with her, and making even
those she favoured dependent on her for
some necessary item, so that war meant,
or was intended to mean, the economic ruin
of Italy. What Germany did in Italy she
has done elsewhere; and everywhere her
banking and commerce go hand in hand
with espionage. Signor Gray tells us what
Italy is doing to shake off the German yoke,
and what remains to be done.</p>

<p>"Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has given us a classic.
His book on the British Campaign in France and
Flanders during 1914 will never be superseded. It
must be read by everyone and kept at hand for constant
consultation by all who make a serious study of
the war.... Above all, his entire work is animated
by a noble love of liberty. His is a soul as true as
steel and as transparent as crystal. The power and
sincerity of his narrative have behind them qualities
of moral sympathy and moral indignation which sometimes
draw the reader to his feet."</p>

<p class="center">ENGLAND IN WAR-TIME.</p>

<p class="center">By ANDRE CHEVRILLON.</p>

<p class="center">With a Preface by RUDYARD KIPLING.</p>

<p>A striking, impartial, documented and highly sympathetic study, by a French
scholar, well acquainted with England, of the internal evolution of the country
during the last two years. In seven brilliant and life-like chapters, the author
gives a vivid sketch of the initial attitude of England to the war, of the progressive
alterations in her structure which have resulted from its stress, of the
inevitable opposition they have encountered, and examines the ultimate causes
alike of changes and opposition. The book is indispensable to all who wish to
obtain a clear and scientific view, undistorted by party feeling, of the epoch-making
crisis through which our country is passing.</p>

<p class="center">The Spirit of New Germanism. A Documentation.</p>

<p class="center">By J. P. BANG, D.D.,</p>

<p class="center"><i>Professor of Theology at the University of Copenhagen</i>.</p>

<p>"My purpose in writing this book is to describe a movement in Germany
which has been active for a long time, but which during the war has recklessly
cast aside all considerations. This movement is twofold: New Germany's view
of other nations, and her valuation of herself and her supposed mission in the
world. My book takes the form of a comprehensive documentation showing the
manifold forms, the wide scope, and the strength of this movement, which, if its
ideas prevail, will be of the most fatal importance for Germanism and to the
world at large."</p>

<p class="center">COMRADES IN ARMS.</p>

<p class="center">By CAPITAINE PHILIPPE MILLET.</p>

<p>Capitaine Philippe Millet, already known as the author of "Jenny s'en
va-t-elle en guerre," has written a number of stories illustrating life in France
to-day. Most of the stories vividly picture the actual life in the trenches and
the barrack room, and show in simple and direct fashion the common bond that
is being forged between the soldiers of our country and those of France. These
stories are a revelation of the English Tommy as seen through the eyes of a
French officer, and the delightful vein of humour running all through will hold
the reader spellbound to the end. It is doubtful whether from any other source
it is possible to obtain such a series of realistic impressions of the English soldier
as seen by one of our Allies in actual warfare.</p>
